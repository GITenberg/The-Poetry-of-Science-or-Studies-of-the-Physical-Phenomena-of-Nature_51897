<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Since 1848, when the “Poetry of Science” was first
submitted to the public, two editions have been exhausted.
This, were proofs required, would of itself
show that there is a large circle of readers to whom
the deductions of science have an unfailing interest.
Beyond this, it conveys an assurance that every truth,
however abstract it may appear, has a large popular value
if studied in its relations to those generalities which
embrace great natural phenomena. With this persuasion
the third edition of the “Poetry of Science”
has been extended so as to include all the important
discoveries which have been made in Natural Philosophy
to the end of the year 1853. It is now presented
to the world in a new and cheaper form, in the
hope, that, with the extension of its circulation, there
may be awakened, in still larger circles, a deep and
healthful interest in the sciences of which the volume
treats.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The True is the Beautiful. Whenever this becomes
evident to our senses, its influences are of a soul-elevating
character. The beautiful, whether it is perceived
in the external forms of matter, associated in the
harmonies of light and colour, appreciated in the
modulations of sweet sounds, or mingled with those
influences which are, as the inner life of creation, ever
appealing to the soul through the vesture which covers
all things, is the natural theme of the poet, and the
chosen study of the philosopher.</p>

<p>But, it will be asked, where is the relation between
the stern labours of science and the ethereal system
which constitutes poetry? The fumes of the laboratory,
its alkalies and acids, the mechanical appliances of the
observatory, its specula and its lenses, do not appear
fitted for a place in the painted bowers of the Muses.
But, from the labours of the chemist in his cell,&mdash;from
the multitudinous observations of the astronomer on his
tower,&mdash;spring truths which the philosopher employs to
interpret nature’s mysteries, and which give to the soul
of the poet those realities to which he aspires in his high
imaginings.</p>

<p>Science solicits from the material world, by the
persuasion of inductive search, a development of its
elementary principles, and of the laws which these obey.
Philosophy strives to apply the discovered facts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>
great phenomena of being,&mdash;to deduce large generalities
from the fragmentary discoveries of severe induction,&mdash;and
thus to ascend from matter and its properties up to
those impulses which stir the whole, floating, as it were,
on the confines of sense, and indicating, though dimly,
those superior powers which, more nearly related to
infinity, mysteriously manifest themselves in the phenomena
of mind. Poetry seizes the facts of the one
and the theories of the other; unites them by a pleasing
thought, which appeals for truth to the most unthinking
soul, and leads the reflective intellect to higher and
higher exercises; it connects common phenomena with
exalted ideas; and, applying its holiest powers, it invests
the human mind with the sovereign strength of the
True.</p>

<p>Truth is the soul of the poet’s thought;&mdash;truth is
the reward of the philosopher’s toil; and their works,
bearing this stamp, live among men through all time.
Science at present rejoices in her ministry to the requirements
of advancing civilization, and is content to receive
the reward given to applications which increase the
comforts of life, or add to its luxuries. Every improvement
in the arts or manufactures, beyond encreasing
utilities for society, has a tendency to elevate the race.
Science is ever useful in the working days of our week,
but it is not to be neglected on our Sabbath,&mdash;when,
resting from our labours, it becomes agreeable to contemplate
the few truths permitted to our knowledge,
and thus enter into communion as closely as is allowed
to finite beings, with those influences which involve and
interpenetrate the earth, giving to all things Life,
Beauty, and Divinity.</p>

<p>The human mind naturally delights in the discovery
of truth; and even when perverted by the constant
operations of prevailing errors, a glimpse of the Real
comes upon it like the smile of daylight to the sorrowing
captive of some dark prison. The Psychean labours to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span>
try man’s soul, and exalt it, are the search for truth
beneath the mysteries which surround creation,&mdash;to
gather amaranths, shining with the hues of heaven,
from plains upon which hang, dark and heavy, the mists
of earth. The poet may pay the debt of nature,&mdash;the
philosopher may return to the bosom of our common
mother,&mdash;even their names fade in the passage of time,
like planets blotted out of heaven but the truths
they have revealed to man burn on for ever with unextinguishable
brightness. Truth cannot die; it passes
from mind to mind, imparting light in its progress, and
constantly renewing its own brightness during its diffusion.
The True is the Beautiful; and the truths
revealed to the mind render us capable of perceiving
new beauties on the earth. The gladness of truth is like
the ringing voice of a joyous child, and the most remote
recesses echo with the cheerful sound. To be for ever
true is the Science of Poetry,&mdash;the revelation of truth
is the Poetry of Science.</p>

<p>Man, a creation endued with mighty faculties, but a
mystery to himself, stands in the midst of a wonderful
world, and an infinite variety of phenomena arise around
him in strange form and magical disposition, like the
phantasma of a restless night.</p>

<p>The solid rock obeys a power which brings its congeries
of atoms into a thousand shapes, each one geometrically
perfect. Its vegetable covering, in obedience
to some external excitation, developes itself in a curious
diversity of forms, from the exquisitely graceful to the
singularly grotesque, and exhibits properties still more
varied and opposed. The animal organism quickened
by higher impulses,&mdash;powers working within, and modifying
the influence of the external forces,&mdash;presents,
from the Monad to the Mammoth, and through every
phase of being up to Man, a yet more wonderful series
of combinations, and features still more strangely contrasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a>[Pg xii]</span></p>

<p>Lifting our searching gaze into the measureless space
beyond our earth, we find planet bound to planet, and
system chained to system, all impelled by a universal
force to roll in regularity and order around a common
centre. The pendulations of the remotest star are communicated
through the unseen bond; and our rocking
world obeys the mysterious impulse throughout all those
forces which regulate the inorganic combinations of this
earth, and unto which its organic creation is irresistibly
compelled to bow.</p>

<p>The glorious sun by day, and the moon and stars in
the silence and the mystery of night, are felt to influence
all material nature, holding the great Earth bound in a
many-stranded cord which cannot be broken. The
tidal flow of the vast ocean, with its variety of animal
and vegetable life, the atmosphere, bright with light,
obscured by the storm-cloud, spanned by the rainbow,
or rent with the explosions of electric fire,&mdash;attest to the
might of these elementary bonds.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the great phenomena which
play their part around this globe of ours, exciting men
to wonder, or shaking them with terror.</p>

<p>The mind of man, in its progress towards its higher
destiny, is tasked with the physical earth as a problem,
which, within the limits of a life, it must struggle to
solve. The intellectual spirit is capable of embracing
all finite things. Man is gifted with powers for studying
the entire circle of visible creation; and he is equal,
under proper training, to the task of examining much
of the secret machinery which stirs the whole.</p>

<p>In dim outshadowing, earth’s first poets, from the
loveliness of external nature, evoked beautiful <span class="correction" title="In the original book: spirtualizations">spiritualizations</span>.
To them the shady forests teemed with aërial
beings,&mdash;the gushing springs rejoiced in fantastic sprites,&mdash;the
leaping cataracts gleamed with translucent shades,&mdash;the
cavernous hills were the abodes of genii,&mdash;and the
earth-girdling ocean was guarded by mysterious forms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a>[Pg xiii]</span>
Such were the creations of the far-searching mind in its
early consciousness of the existence of unseen powers.
The philosopher picked out his way through the dark
and labyrinthine path, between effects and causes, and
slowly approaching towards the light, he gathered
semblances of the great Reality, like a mirage, beautiful
and truthful, although still but a cloud-reflection of the
vast Unseen.</p>

<p>It is thus that the human mind advances from the
Ideal to the Real, and that the poet becomes the philosopher,
and the philosopher rises into the poet; but at
the same time as we progress from fable to fact, much
of the soul-sentiment which made the romantic holy,
and gave a noble tone to every aspiration, is too
frequently merged in a cheerless philosophy which clings
to the earth, and reduces the mind to a mechanical
condition, delighting in the accumulation of facts, regardless
of the great laws by which these are regulated,
and the harmony of all Telluric combinations secured.
In science we find the elements of the most exalted
poetry; and in the mysterious workings of the physical
forces we discover connections with the illimitable world
of thought,&mdash;in which mighty minds delight to try their
powers,&mdash;as strangely complicated, and as marvellously
ordered, as in the psychological phenomena which have,
almost exclusively, been the objects of their studies.</p>

<p>In the aspect of visible nature, with its wonderful
diversity of form and its charm of colour, we find the
Beautiful; and in the operations of these principles,
which are ever active in producing and maintaining the
existing conditions of matter, we discover the Sublime.</p>

<p>The form and colour of a flower may excite our
admiration; but when we come to examine all the
phenomena which combine to produce that piece of
symmetry and that lovely hue,&mdash;to learn the physiological
arrangement of its structural parts,&mdash;the chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a>[Pg xiv]</span>
actions by which its woody fibre and its juices are produced,&mdash;and
to investigate those laws by which is
regulated the power to throw back the white sunbeam
from its surface in coloured rays,&mdash;our admiration passes
to the higher feeling of deep astonishment at the perfection
of the processes, and of reverence for their great
Designer. There are, indeed, “tongues in trees;” but
science alone can interpret their mysterious whispers,
and in this consists its poetry.</p>

<p>To rest content with the bare enunciation of a truth,
is to perform but one half of a task. As each atom of
matter is involved in an atmosphere of properties and
powers, which unites it to every mass of the universe, so
each truth, however common it may be, is surrounded
by impulses which, being awakened, pass from soul to
soul like musical undulations, and which will be repeated
through the echoes of space, and prolonged for all
eternity.</p>

<p>The poetry which springs from the contemplation of
the agencies which are actively employed in producing
the transformation of matter, and which is founded upon
the truths developed by the aids of science, should be in
no respect inferior to that which has been inspired by
the beauty of the individual forms of matter, and the
pleasing character of their combinations.</p>

<p>The imaginative view of man and his world&mdash;the
creations of the romantic mind&mdash;have been, and ever
will be, dwelt on with a soul-absorbing passion. The
mystery of our being, and the mystery of our ceasing to
be, acting upon intelligences which are for ever striving
to comprehend the enigma of themselves, leads by a
natural process to a love for the Ideal. The discovery
of those truths which advance the human mind towards
that point of knowledge to which all its secret longings
tend, should excite a higher feeling than any mere creation
of the fancy, how beautiful soever it may be. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv"></a>[Pg xv]</span>
phenomena of Reality are more startling than the phantoms
of the Ideal. Truth is stranger than fiction.
Surely many of the discoveries of science which relate to
the combinations of matter, and exhibit results which
we could not by any previous efforts of reasoning dare
to reckon on, results which show the admirable balance
of the forces of nature, and the might of their uncontrolled
power, exhibit to our senses subjects for contemplation
truly poetic in their character.</p>

<p>We tremble when the thunder-cloud bursts in fury
above our heads. The poet seizes on the terrors of the
storm to add to the interest of his verse. Fancy paints
a storm-king, and the genius of romance clothes his
demons in lightnings, and they are heralded by thunders.
These wild imaginings have been the delight of mankind;
there is subject for wonder in them: but is there
anything less wonderful in the well-authenticated fact,
the dew-drop which glistens on the flower, that the tear
which trembles on the eye-lid, holds locked in its transparent
cells an amount of electric fire equal to that
which is discharged during a storm from a thunder-cloud?</p>

<p>In these studies of the effects which are continually
presenting themselves to the observing eye, and of the
phenomena of causes, as far as they are revealed by
Science in its search of the physical earth, it will be
shown that beneath the beautiful vesture of the external
world there exists, like its quickening soul, a pervading
power, assuming the most varied aspects, giving to the
whole its life and loveliness, and linking every portion
of this material mass in a common bond with some great
universal principle beyond our knowledge. Whether by
the improvement of the powers of the human mind,
man will ever be enabled to embrace within his knowledge
the laws which regulate these remote principles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"></a>[Pg xvi]</span>
we are not sufficiently advanced in intelligence to determine.
But if admitted even to a clear perception
of the theoretical Power which we regard as regulating
the known forces, we must still see an unknown agency
beyond us, which can only be referred to the Creator’s
will.</p>

<p class="center">GENERAL CONDITIONS OF MATTER.</p>


<p class="chap-head">Its varied Characters, and constant change of external Form&mdash;The
Grain of Dust, its Properties and Powers&mdash;Combinations
in inorganic Masses and in organized Creations&mdash;Our
knowledge of Matter&mdash;Theory of Ultimate
Atoms&mdash;The Physical Forces acting on the Composition of
Masses&mdash;The certainty of the exercise of subtile principles,
which are beyond the reach of experimental Science.</p>


<p class="p2">The Physical Earth presents to us, in every form of
organic and inorganic matter, an infinite variety of
phenomena. If we select specimens of rocks, either
crystalline or stratified,&mdash;of metals in any of their
various combinations with oxygen, sulphur, and other
bodies,&mdash;of gems glistening with light and glowing with
colour,&mdash;if we examine the varied forms and hues of the
vegetable world, or the more mysterious animal creations,
we must inevitably come to the conclusion, long
since proclaimed, and admit that dust they are, and to
dust must they return. Whatever permanency may be
given to matter, it is certain that its form is ever in a
state of change. The surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span> “Eternal Hills”
is worn away by the soft rains which fall to fertilize,
and from their wrecks, borne by the waters to the
ocean, new continents are forming. The mutations of
the old earth may be read upon her rocks and mountains,
and these records of former changes tell us the infallible
truth, that as the present passes into the future, so will
the form of Earth undergo an important alteration.
The same forces which lifted the Andes and the Himalayas
are still at work, and from the particles of matter
carried from the present lands by the rivers into the sea,
where they subside in stratified masses, there will, in
the great future, be raised new worlds, upon which the
work of life will go forward, and over which will be
spread a vast Intelligence.</p>

<p>If we regard the conditions of the beautiful and varied
organic covering of the Earth, the certainty, the constancy,
of change is ever before us. Vegetable life
passes into the animal form, and both perish to feed the
future plant. Man, moving to-day the monarch of a
mighty people, in a few years passes back to his primitive
clod, and that combination of elementary atoms,
which is dignified with the circle of sovereignty and the
robe of purple, after a period may be sought for in the
herbage of the fields, or in the humble flowers of the
valley.</p>

<p>We have, then, this certain truth,&mdash;all things visible
around us are but aggregations of atoms. From particles
of dust, which under the microscope could scarcely
be distinguished one from the other, are all the varied
forms of nature created. This grain of dust, this particle
of sand, has strange properties and powers. Science has
discovered some truths, but still more are hidden within
this irregular molecule of matter which we now survey,
than have yet been shadowed in the dreams of our
philosophy. How strangely it obeys the impulses of
heat&mdash;mysterious are the influences of light upon it&mdash;electricity
wonderfully excites it&mdash;and still more curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
is the manner in which it obeys the magic of chemical
force. These are phenomena which we have seen; we
know them, and we can reproduce them at our pleasure.
We have advanced a little way into the secrets of nature,
and from the spot we have gained, we look forward
with a vision somewhat brightened by our task; but we
discover so much to be yet unknown, that we learn
another truth,&mdash;our vast ignorance of many things
relating to this grain of dust.</p>

<p>It gathers around it other particles; they cling
together, and each acting upon every other one, and all
of them arranging themselves around the little centre
according to some law, a beautiful crystal results, the
geometric perfection of its form being a source of admiration.</p>

<p>It exerts some other powers, and atom cohering to
atom, obeying the influences of many external radiant
forces, undergoes inexplicable changes, and the same
dust which we find forming the diamond, aggregates
into the lordly tree,&mdash;blends to produce the graceful,
scented, and richly painted flower,&mdash;and combines to
yield the luxury of fruit.</p>

<p>It quickens with yet undiscovered energies; it moves
with life: dust is stirred by the mysterious excitement
of vital force; and blood and bone, nerve and muscle,
are the results. Forces, which we cannot by the utmost
refinements of our philosophy detect, direct the whole,
and from the same dust which formed the rock and
grew in the tree, is produced a living and a breathing
thing, capable of receiving a Divine illumination, of
bearing in its new state the gladness and the glory of a
Soul.</p>

<p>These considerations lead us to reflect on the amount
of our knowledge. We are led to ask ourselves, what
do we know? We know that the world with all its
variety is composed of certain material atoms, which,
although presented to us in a great variety of forms, do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
not in all probability differ very essentially from each
other.</p>

<p>We know that those atoms obey certain conditions
which appear to be dependent upon the influences of
motion, gravitation, heat, light, electricity, and chemical
force. These powers are only known to us by their
effects; we only detect their action by their operations
upon matter; and although we regard the several
phenomena which we have discovered, as the manifestations
of different principles, it is possible they may be
but modifications of some one universal power, of which
these are but a few of its modes of action.</p>

<p>In examining, therefore, the truths which science has
revealed to us, it is advantageous, for the purpose of
fixing the mind to the subject, that we assume certain
conditions as true. These may be stated in a few sentences,
and then, without wasting a thought upon those
metaphysical subtleties which have from time to time
perplexed science, and served to impede the progress of
truth, we shall proceed to examine our knowledge of
the phenomena which constantly occur around us.</p>

<p>Every form, whether inorganic or organic, which we
can discover within the limits of human search, is composed
of atoms, which are capable of assuming, under
the influence of certain physical forces, conditions essential
to the physical state of that body of which they
constitute a part.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The known forces, active in pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>ducing
these conditions, are modes of motion; gravitation
and aggregation, heat, light; and associated with
these, actinism or chemical radiation; electricity, under
all its conditions, whether static or dynamic; and
chemical affinity, regarded as the result of a separate
elementary principle.</p>

<p>These forces must be considered as powers capable of
acting in perfect independence of each other. They are
possibly modifications of one principle; but this view
being an hypothesis, which, as yet, is only supported by
loose analogies, cannot, without danger, be received in
any explanation which attempts to deal only with the
truths of science.</p>

<p>We cannot examine the varied phenomena of nature,
without feeling that there must be other and most active
principles of a higher order than any detected by science,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
to which belong the important operations of vitality,
whether manifested in the plant or the animal. In
treating of these, although speculation cannot be entirely
avoided, it will be employed only so far as it gives any
assistance in linking phenomena together.</p>

<p>We have to deal with the active agencies which give
form and feature to nature&mdash;which regulate the harmony
and beauty and vigour of life&mdash;and upon which depend
those grand changes in the conditions of matter, which
must convince us that death is but the commencement
of a new state of being.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Sir Isaac Newton supposed matter to consist of hard,
impenetrable, perfectly inelastic atoms.
</p>
<p>
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Boscovitch">Boscovich</span> regarded the constitution of matter differently. The
ultimate atom was with him a point surrounded by powers of infinite
elasticity. (See <i>Dr. Robisons Mechanical Philosophy</i>, for a
full explanation of the theory of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Boscovitch">Boscovich</span>.)
</p>
<p>
The view entertained by Dr. Faraday, which will be comprehended
from one or two short extracts from his valuable and
suggestive paper, claims attention:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“If the view of the constitution of matter already referred to be
assumed to be correct&mdash;and I may be allowed to speak of the
particles of matter, and the space between them (in water, or in
the vapour of water, for instance), as two different things&mdash;the
space must be taken as the only continuous part, for the particles
are considered as separated by space from each other. Space will
permeate all masses of matter in every direction like a net, except
that in the place of meshes it will form cells, isolating each atom
from its neighbours, and itself only being continuous.”
</p>
<p>
Examining the question of the conducting power of different
bodies, and observing that as space is the only continuous part,
so space, according to the received view of matter, must be at one
time a conductor, at others a non-conductor, it is remarked:
</p>
<p>
“It would seem, therefore, that, in accepting the ordinary
atomic theory, space may be proved to be a non-conductor in non-conducting
bodies, and a conductor in conducting bodies; but
the reasoning ends in this&mdash;a subversion of that theory altogether;
for, if space be an insulator, it cannot exist in conducting bodies;
and if it be a conductor, it cannot exist in insulating bodies.”&mdash;<i>A

<p class="chap-head">Are the Physical Forces modes of Motion?&mdash;Motion defined&mdash;Philosophical
Views of Motion, and the Principles to which
it has been referred&mdash;Motions of the Earth and of the Solar
System&mdash;Visible Proofs of the Earth’s Motion on its Axis&mdash;Influence

of Motion, although the Cause and often apparently

<p class="p2">Many of the most eminent thinkers of the present time
are disposed to regard all the active principles of nature
as “modes of motion,”&mdash;to look upon light, heat, electricity,
and even vital force, as phenomena resulting from
“change of place” among the particles of matter; this
change, disturbance, or motion, being dependent upon
some undefined mover.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The habit of leaving purely inductive examination for
the delusive charms of hypothesis&mdash;of viewing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
material world as a metaphysical bundle of essential
properties, and nothing more&mdash;has led some eminent
philosophers to struggle with the task of proving that
all the wonderful manifestations of the great physical
powers of the universe are but modifications of motion,
without the evidence of any antecedent force.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The views of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: metaphyscians">metaphysicians</span> regarding motion involve
many subtle considerations which need not at present
detain us. We can only consider motion as a change of
place in a given mass of matter. Now matter cannot
effect this of itself, no change of place being possible
without a mover; and, consequently, motion cannot be
a <i>property</i> of matter, in the strict sense in which that
term should be accepted.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>Motion depends upon certain external disturbing and
directing forces acting upon all matter; and, consequently,
as every mode of action is determined by some
excitement external to the body moved, motion cannot,
philosophically, be regarded otherwise than as a peculiar
affection of matter under determinable conditions.
“We find,” says Sir Isaac Newton, “but little motion
in the world, except what plainly flows from either the
active principles of nature, or from the command of the
willer.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>Plato, Aristotle, and the Pythagoreans, supposed that
throughout all nature an active principle was diffused,
upon which depended all the properties exhibited by
matter. This is the same as the “plastic nature” of
Cudworth,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the “intellectual and artificial fire” of
Bishop Berkeley;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and to these all modes of motion
were referred. Sir Isaac Newton also regards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
material universe and its phenomena as dependent upon
“<i>active principles</i>”&mdash;for instance, the cause of gravity&mdash;whereby
the planets and comets preserve their motions
in their orbits, and all bodies acquire a degree of motion
in falling; and the cause of fomentation&mdash;whereby the
heart and blood of animals preserve a perpetual warmth
and motion&mdash;the inner parts of the earth are kept constantly
warmed&mdash;many bodies burn and shine&mdash;and the
sun himself burns and shines, and with his light warms
and cheers all things.</p>

<p>The earth turns on its axis at the rate of more than
1,000 miles an hour, and passes around the sun with
the speed of upwards of 68,000 miles in the same time.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The earth and the other planets of our system move in
ellipses around a common centre: therefore their motion
cannot have been originally communicated merely by
the impressed force of projection. Two forces, at least,
must have operated, one making the planets tend
directly to the centre, and the other impelling them to
fly off at a tangent to the curve described. Here we
have a system of spheres, held by some power to a great
central mass, around which they revolve with a fearful
velocity. Nor is this all; the Solar System itself,
bound by the same mystic chain to an undiscovered
centre, moves towards a point in space at the rate of
33,550,000 geographical miles, whilst our earth performs
one revolution around the sun.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>The evidence of the motion of the Earth around its
axis, as afforded by the swinging of a pendulum or the
rotation of a sphere, is too interesting to be omitted.
In mechanical philosophy, we have two terms of the
same general meaning&mdash;the conservation of the plane of
vibration&mdash;and the conservation of the axis of rotation.
For the non-scientific reader, these terms require
explanation, and in endeavouring to simplify this as
much as possible, we must ask the indulgence of the
Mechanical Philosopher. Let us fix in the centre of a
small round table an upright rod, having an arm extending
from its top, to which we can suspend a tolerably
heavy weight attached to a string. This is our piece of
apparatus: upon the table draw a chalk line, along
which line we intend our pendulum to swing, and continuing
this line upon the floor, or by a mark on the
wall, our arrangements are complete. Raise steadily
the bob of our pendulum, and set it free, so that its
plane of vibration is along the line which has been
marked. As the pendulum is swinging firmly along
this line, slowly and steadily turn the table round. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
will then be seen that the pendulum will still vibrate in the
direction of the line we have continued onward to the wall,
but that the line on the table is gradually withdrawn
from it. If we had no upright, we might turn the table
entirely round, without in the slightest degree altering
the line along which the pendulum performs its oscillations.
Now, if from some elevated spot, say, from the
centre of the dome of St. Paul’s, a long and heavy pendulum
is suspended, and if on the floor we mark the line
along which we set the pendulum free to vibrate, it will
be seen, as in the experiment with the table, that the
marked line moves away from under the pendulum. It
continues to vibrate in the plane it first described,
although the line on the earth’s surface continues to
move forward by the diurnal rotation around the axis.
Similar to this is the law of the conservation of the axis
of rotation. If a common humming-top, the spindle of
which is its axis of rotation, is set spinning obliquely, it
will be seen that the axis will continue to point along
the line it took at the commencement of motion.
By placing a heavy sphere in a lathe, resting its projecting
axial points on some moveable bearings, and then
getting the sphere into extremely rapid motion, one of the
bearings may be removed without the mass falling to
the ground. The rapidity of motion changes so constantly
and quickly the position of the particles which
have a tendency to fall, that we have motion balanced
against the force of gravitation in a striking manner;
and we learn, from this experiment, the explanation
of the planetary and stellar masses revolving on their
axis at a speed sufficient to maintain them without support
in space. A mass of matter, a sphere or a disc,
carefully balanced, is fixed in gymbals such as we employ
for fixing our compass needles, and it is set by some
mechanical contrivance in rapid rotation. The position
of the axis of rotation remains unaltered, although the
earth is moving; and thus, by this instrument,&mdash;called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
gyroscope,&mdash;we can determine, as with the pendulum, the
motion of the earth around its axis; and we learn why,
during its movement around the sun, its axis is undeviatingly
pointed towards one point in space, marked in
our Heavens as the Polar Star.</p>

<p>In addition to these great rotations, the earth is subjected
to other motions, as the precession of the equinoxes
and the nutation of its axis. Rocking regularly
upon a point round which it rapidly revolves, whilst it
progresses onward in its orbit, like some huge top in
tremulous gyration upon the deck of a vast <span class="correction" title="In the original book: aerial">aërial</span> ship
gliding rapidly through space, is the earth performing
its part in the great law of motion.</p>

<p>The rapidity of these impulses, supposing the powers
of the physical forces were for a moment suspended,
would be sufficient to scatter the mass of our planet
over space as a mere star-dust.</p>

<p>Limiting, as much as possible, the view which opens
upon the mind as we contemplate the adjustments by
which this great machine, our system, is preserved in all
its order and beauty, let us forget the great movement
of the whole through space, and endeavour to consider
the effect of those motions which are directly related to
the earth, as a member of one small group of worlds.</p>

<p>We cannot for a moment doubt, although we have not
any experimental proof of the fact, that the proper
motions of the earth materially influence the conditions
of the matter of which it is formed. Every pair of
atoms is, like a balance, delicately suspended, under
the constant struggle which arises from the tendency to
fly asunder, induced by one order of forces&mdash;centrifugal
force&mdash;and the efforts of others, gravitation and cohesion,
to chain them together. The spring is brought to
the highest state of tension&mdash;one tremor more, and it
would be destroyed.</p>

<p>We cannot, by any comparison with the labours of
the most skilful human artisan, convey an idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
exquisite perfection of planetary mechanics, even so far
as they have been discovered by the labours of science;
and we must admit that our insight into the vast
machinery has been very limited.</p>

<p>All we know is the fact that this planet moves in a
certain order, and at a fixed rate, and that the speed is
of itself sufficient to rend the hardest rocks; yet the
delicate down which rests so lightly upon the flower is
undisturbed. It is, therefore, evident that matter is
endued with powers, by which mass is bound to mass,
and atom to atom; these powers are not the results of
any of the motions which we have examined, but,
acting in antagonism to them, they sustain our globe in
its present form.</p>

<p>Are there other motions to which these powers can be
referred? We know of none. That absolute rest may
not exist among the particles of matter is probable.
Electrical action, chemical power, crystalline aggregation,
the expansive force of heat, and many other known
agencies, are in constant operation to prevent it. It
must, however, be remembered, that each and every
atom constituting a mass may be so suspended between
the balanced forces, that it may be regarded as relatively
at rest.</p>

<p>Theory imagines Motion as producing Force&mdash;a body
is moved, and its mere mechanical change of place is
regarded as generating heat; and hence the refinements
of modern science have advanced to the conclusion that
motion and heat are convertible. Admitting that the
material atoms of which this world is formed are never
in a state of quiescence, yet we cannot suppose any gross
ponderable particle as capable of moving itself; but
once set in motion, it may become the secondary cause
of motion in other particles.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The difficulties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
case would appear to have been as follows:&mdash;Are heat,
light, electricity, &amp;c., material bodies? If they are
material bodies&mdash;and heat, for example, is the cause of
motion&mdash;must not the calorific matter move itself&mdash;or if
it be not self-moving, by what is it moved? If heat is
material, and the primary cause of motion, then matter
must have an innate power of moving; it can convert
itself into active force, or be at once a cause and an
effect, which can scarcely be regarded as a logical
deduction.</p>

<p>We move a particle of matter, and heat is manifested;
the force being continued, light, electricity, and chemical
action result; all, as appears from a limited view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
the phenomena, arising out of the mechanical force
applied to the particle first moved.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This mechanical
force, it must be remembered, is external to the body
moved, and is, in all probability, set up by the movement
of a muscle, acted upon by nerves, under the
influence of a will.</p>

<p>The series of phenomena we have supposed to arise
admit of an explanation free of the hypothesis of motion,
and we avoid the dangerous ground of metaphysical
speculation, and the subtleties of that logic which rests
upon the immateriality of all creation. This explanation, it
is freely admitted, is incomplete: we cannot distinctly
correlate each feature of the phenomena, combine link
to link, and thus form a perfect chain; but it is sufficiently
clear to exhibit what we do know, and leave the
unknown free for unbiassed investigation.</p>

<p>Each particle, each atom of that which conveys to our
senses the only ideas we have of natural objects&mdash;ponderable
matter&mdash;is involved in, or interpenetrated by,
those principles which we call heat and electricity, with
probably many others which are unknown to us; and
although these principles or powers are, according to
some law, bound in statical equilibrium to inert matter,
they are freely developed by an external excitement, and
the disturbance of any one of them, upsetting the equilibrium,
leaves the other power equally free to be brought
under the cognizance of human sense by their effects.</p>

<p>When we come to an examination of the influences
exerted by these powers upon the physical earth, the
position, that they must be regarded as the causes of
motion rather than the effects of it, will be further considered.
At present it is only necessary to state thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
generally the views we entertain of the conditions of
matter in connection with the imponderable forces and
mechanical powers. The conversion, as it has been
called, of motion into heat, in the experiments of Count
Rumford and Mr. Joule,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> are only evidences that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
certain uniformity exists between the mechanical force
applied, and the amount of heat liberated. It does not
appear that we have any proof of the conversion of
motion into physical power.</p>

<p>It is necessary, to a satisfactory contemplation of the
wonderful properties of matter, and of the forces regulating
the forms of the entire creation, that we should
be content with regarding the elementary bodies which
chemistry instructs us form our globe, as tangible, ponderable
atoms, having specific and distinguishing properties.
That we should, as far as it is possible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
finite minds to do so, endeavour to conceive the powers
or forces&mdash;gravitation, molecular attraction, electricity,
heat, light, and the principle which determines all
chemical phenomena&mdash;as manifestations of agencies
which hold a place between the most subtile form of
matter and the hidden principles of vitality, which is still
vastly inferior to the spiritual state, which reveals itself
dimly in psychological phenomena, and arrives at its
sublimity in the God of the universe.</p>

possibly be moved but by a body contiguous and moved</i>&mdash;Boyle asks:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“I demand how there comes to be local motion in the world?
For either all the portions of matter that compose the universe
have motion belonging to their natures, which the Epicureans
affirmed for their atoms, or some parts of matter have this motive
power, and some have not, or else none of them have it; but all
of them are naturally devoid of motion. If it be granted that
motion does naturally belong to all parts of matter, the dispute is
at an end, the concession quite overthrowing the hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
“If Mr. Hobbes should reply that the motion is impressed
upon any of the parts of matter by God, he will say that which
I most readily grant to be true, but will not serve his turn, if he
would speak congruously with his own hypothesis. For I demand
whether this Supreme Being that the assertion has recourse to, be
a corporeal or an incorporeal substance? If it be the latter, and
yet the efficient cause of motion in bodies, then it will not be universally
true that whatever body is moved is so by a body contiguous
and moved. For, in our supposition, the bodies that God
moves, either immediately or by the intervention of any other
immaterial being, are not moved by a body contiguous, but by an
incorporeal spirit.”&mdash;<i>Some Considerations about the Reconcileableness

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Boyle has some ingenious speculations on this point:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“That there is local motion in many parts of matter is manifest
to sense, but how matter came by this motion was of old, and is
still, hotly disputed of: for the ancient Corpuscularian philosophers
(whose doctrine in most other points, though not in all, we
are the most inclinable to), not acknowledging an author of the
universe, were thereby reduced to make motion congenite to
matter, and consequently coeval with it. But since local motion,
or an endeavour at it, is not included in the nature of matter,
which is as much matter when it rests as when it moves; and
since we see that the same portion of matter may from motion be
reduced to rest, and after it hath continued at rest, so long as other
bodies do not put it out of that state, may by external agents be
set a moving again; I, who am not wont to think a man the worse
naturalist for not being an atheist, shall not scruple to say with an
eminent philosopher of old, whom I find to have proposed among
the Greeks that opinion (for the main) that the excellent Des Cartes
has revived amongst us, that the origin of motion in matter is
from God; and not only so, but that thinking it very unfit to be
believed, that matter barely put into motion, and then left to
itself, should casually constitute this beautiful and orderly world;
I think also further, that the wise Author of things did, by establishing
the laws of motion among bodies, and by guiding the first
motions of the small parts of matter, bring them to convene after
the manner requisite to compose the world; and especially did
contrive those curious and elaborate engines, the bodies of living
creatures, endowing most of them with the power of propagating
their species.”&mdash;<i>Considerations and Experiments touching the Origin

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Count Rumford’s experiment consisted in placing a mass of
metal in a box of water at a known temperature, and, by employing
a boring apparatus, ascertaining carefully the increase of
heat after a given number of revolutions. He thus describes his
most satisfactory experiment:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Everything being ready, I proceeded to make the experiment
I had projected, in the following manner. The hollow
cylinder having been previously cleaned out, and the inside of
its bore wiped with a clean towel till it was quite dry, the square
iron bar, with the blunt steel borer fixed to the end of it, was
put into its place; the mouth of the bore of the cylinder being
closed at the same time by means of the circular piston through
the centre of which the iron bar passed.
</p>
<p>
“This being done, the box was put in its place; and the joinings
of the iron rod, and of the neck of the cylinder with the
two ends of the box, having been made water-tight, by means of
collars of oiled leather, the box was filled with cold water (viz., at
the temperature of 60°) and the machine was put in motion. The
result of this beautiful experiment was very striking, and the
pleasure it afforded me amply repaid me for all the trouble I had
had, in contriving and arranging the complicated machinery used
in making it. The cylinder, revolving at the rate of about thirty-two
times in a minute, had been in motion but a short time, when
I perceived, by putting my hand into the water and touching the
outside of the cylinder, that heat was generated, and it was not
long before the water which surrounded the cylinder began to be
sensibly warm. At the end of one hour, I found, by plunging
a thermometer into the water in the box (the quantity of which
fluid amounted to 18·77 lbs. avoirdupois, or 2&ndash;1/4 wine gallons),
that its temperature had been raised no less than 47°; being
now 107° of Fahrenheit’s scale. When thirty minutes more
had elapsed, or one hour and thirty minutes after the machinery
had been put in motion, the heat of the water in the box was
142°. At the end of two hours, reckoning from the beginning
of the experiment, the temperature of the water was found to be
raised to 178°. At two hours twenty minutes it was at 200°;
and at two hours thirty minutes it <i>actually boiled</i>.”&mdash;<i>Inquiry
concerning the Source of the Heat excited by Friction</i>: Philosophical
Transactions, vol. lxxxviii. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1798.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Joule brought a communication on the same subject before
the British Association at Cambridge, which was afterwards
published in the Philosophical Magazine, and from that journal
the following notices are extracted:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“The apparatus exhibited before the Association consisted of
a brass paddle-wheel, working horizontally in a can of water.
Motion could be communicated to this paddle by means of
weights, pulleys, &amp;c. The paddle moved with great resistance
in the can of water, so that the weights (each of four pounds)
descended at the slow rate of about one foot per second. The
height of the pulleys from the ground was twelve yards, and
consequently when the weights had descended through that distance
they had to be wound up again in order to renew the
motion of the paddle. After this operation had been repeated
sixteen times, the increase of the temperature of the water was
ascertained by means of a very sensible and accurate thermometer.
</p>
<p>
“A series of nine experiments was performed in the above
manner, and nine experiments were made in order to eliminate
the cooling or heating effects of the atmosphere. After reducing
the result to the capacity for heat of a pound of water, it appeared
that for each degree of heat evolved by the friction of
water, a mechanical power equal to that which can raise a weight
of 890 lbs. to the height of one foot, had been expended.
</p>
<p>
“Any of your readers who are so fortunate as to reside amid
the romantic scenery of Wales or Scotland could, I doubt not,
confirm my experiments by trying the temperature of the water
at the top and at the bottom of a cascade. If my views be correct,
a fall of 817 feet will of course generate one degree of heat,
and the temperature of the river Niagara will be raised about
one fifth of a degree by its fall of 160 feet.”&mdash;<i>Relation between
Heat and Mechanical Power</i>: Philosoph. Mag. vol. xxvii. 1845.</p></div></div>

<p class="p2">Let us suppose the earth&mdash;consisting of three conditions
of matter; the solid, the fluid, and the aëriform&mdash;to be
set free from that power by which it is retained in its
present form of a spheroid flattened at the poles, but
still subject to the influences of its diurnal and annual
rotations. Agreeably to the law which regulates the
conditions of all bodies moving at high velocities, the
consequence of such a state of things would be, that our
planet would instantly spread itself over an enormous
area. The waters and even the solid masses of this
globe would, in all probability, present themselves amidst
the other phenomena of space in a highly attenuated
state, revolving in an orbit around the sun, as a band of
nebulous matter, which might sometimes be rendered
sensible to sight by still reflecting solar light, or by
condensation in the form of flights of shooting stars.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>This may be illustrated by experiment. If upon a
rapidly revolving disc we place a ball of dust, it will be
almost immediately spread out, and its particles will
arrange themselves in a series of regular curves, varying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
with the velocity of the motion. In addition to the disintegration
which would arise from the tendency of the
atoms to fly from the centre, the motion, in space, of
the planetary mass would naturally occasion a trailing
out, and the only degree of uniformity which this orb
could, under these imaginary conditions, possibly present,
would be derived from the combined effects of
motions in different directions.</p>

<p>Amid the remoter stars, some remarkable cloud-like
appearances are discovered. These nebulæ, presenting
to the eye of the observer only a gleaming light, as from
some phosphorescent vapour, were long regarded as
indications of such a condition as that which we have
just been considering. Astronomers saw, in those mysterious
nebulæ, a confirmation of their views, which
regarded all the orbs of the firmament as having once
been thin sheets of vapour, which had gradually, from
irregular bodies traversing space, been slowly condensed
about a centre, and brought within the limits of aggregating
agencies, until, after the lapse of ages, they
become sphered stars, moving in harmony amid the
bright host of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Geologists seized on those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
views with eagerness, as confirming theoretical conclusions
deduced from an examination of the structure of
the earth itself, and explained by them the gradual
accretion of atoms into crystalline rocks from a cooling
mass.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>The researches of modern astronomers, aided by the
magnificent instruments of Lord Rosse,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> have, however,
shown that many of the most remarkable nebulæ are
only clusters of stars; so remote from us, that the light
from them appears blended into one diffused sheet or
luminous film. There are, however, the Magellanic
clouds, and other singular patches of light, exhibiting
changes which can only be explained on the theory of
their slow condensation. There is no evidence to disprove
the position that world-formation may still be
going on; that a slow and gradual aggregation of particles,
under the influence of laws with which we are
acquainted, may be constantly in progress, to end, eventually,
in the formation of a sphere.</p>

<p>May we not regard the zodiacal light as the remains
of a solar luminiferous atmosphere, which once embraced
the entire system of which it is the centre?<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
the strange changes which have been <i>seen to take place</i>
in cometary bodies, even whilst they were passing near
the earth,&mdash;as the division of Biela’s comet and the
ultimate formation of a second nucleus from the detached
portion,&mdash;strongly tend to support the probability
of the idea that attenuated matter has, in the progress
of time, been condensed into solid masses, and
that nebulous clouds must still exist in every state of
tenuity in the regions of infinite space,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
mysterious processes of world-formation, will, eventually,
become stars, and reflect across the blue immensity of
heaven, in brightness, that light which is the necessary
agent of organisation and all <span class="correction" title="In the original book: manifestatious">manifestations</span> of beauty?</p>

<p>The inferences drawn from a careful study of the condition
of our own globe are in favour of the assumption
of the existence of nebulous matter. By the processes
of art and manufacture, by the operation of those powers
on which organisation and life depend, solid matter is
constantly poured off in such a state that it cannot be
detected, <i>as matter</i>, by any of the human senses. Yet
a thousand results, daily and hourly accumulating as
truths around us, prove that the solid metals, the gross
earths, and the constituents of animal and vegetable life,
all pass away invisible to us, and become “thin air.”
We know that, floating around us, these volatilized
bodies exist in some material form, and numerous experiments
in chemistry are calculated to convince us,
that the most attenuated air is capable, with a slight
change of circumstances, of being converted into the
condition of solid masses. Hydrogen gas, the lightest,
the most ethereal of the chemical elements, dissolves iron
and zinc, arsenic, sulphur, and carbon; and from the
transparent combinations thus formed, we can with
facility separate those ponderous bodies. Such substances
must exist in our own atmosphere; why not
in the regions of space? Whether this planet ever
floated a mass of nebulous matter, only known by its
dim and filmy light, or comet-like rushed through
space with widely eccentric orbit, are questions which
can only receive the reply of speculative minds.
Whether the earth and the other members of the Solar
System were ever parts of a Central Sun,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
from it by some mighty convulsion, though now revolving
with all the other masses around that orb, chained
in their circuits by some infinite power, is beyond the
utmost refinements of science to discover. This hypothesis
is, however, in its sublime conception, worthy of
the master-mind that gave it birth.</p>

<p>All we know is, that our earth is an oblate sphere,
which, by the effects of its rotation around an axis, is
somewhat enlarged at the equator and flattened at the
poles;&mdash;that it maintains its regular course around the
sun, in virtue of the operation of two forces, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
which, acting constantly, would eventually draw it
into the body of the sun itself; but that it is opposed
by the other, centrifugal force, and the varying
momentum of the revolving mass;&mdash;that the same
force acting from the centre of the earth itself, and
from the centre of every particle of its substance,
resolves the whole into a globular form.</p>

<p>The principle of Gravitation<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is that force which
resides in every form of matter, by which particle is
attracted by particle, and mass by mass, the less
towards the greater. What this may be, we scarcely
dare to speculate. In the vast area of its action, which
opens before the eye of the mind, we see a power spanning
all space, and linking together every one of those
myriads of worlds which spangle the robe of the Infinite,
and we are compelled to pause. Is this principle
of gravitation a property of matter, or is it a power
higher than the more tangible forces, is the question
which presses on the mind. If we regard it as a subtile
principle pervading all space, we compel ourselves to
look beyond it for another power yet more refined; and
we cannot halt until, ascending from the limitable to
the illimitable, we resolve gravitation and its governing
influences to the centre of all power&mdash;the will of the
eternal Creator.</p>

<p>Science has developed the grand truth, that it is by
the exercise of this all-pervading influence that the
earth is retained in its orbit&mdash;that the pellucid globe of
dew which glistens on the leaf is bound together&mdash;that
the débris which float upon the lake accumulate into
one mass&mdash;that the sea exhibits the phenomena of the
tides&mdash;and the aërial ocean its barometric changes. In
all things this force is active, and throughout nature it
is ever present. Our knowledge of the laws which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
obeys, enables us to conclude that the sun and distant
planets are consolidated masses like this earth. We
find that they have gravitating power, and by comparing
this influence with that exerted by the earth, we
are enabled to weigh the mass of one planet against
another. In the balance of the astronomer, it is as
easy to poise the remote star, as it is for the engineer
to calculate the weight of the iron tunnel of the Menai
Straits, or any other mechanical structure. Thus throughout
the universe the balance of gravitating force is unerringly
sustained. If one of the most remote of those
gems of light, which flicker at midnight in the dark
distance of the starry vault, was, by any power, removed
from its place, the disturbance of these delicately balanced
mysteries would be felt through all the created
systems of worlds.</p>

<p>From the peculiarity of the laws which this power
called gravity obeys, it has been inferred that it acts
from centres of force; it is proved that its power diminishes
in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance,
and that the gravitating power of every material body
is in the direct proportion of its mass. In astronomical
calculations we have first to learn the mass of our
earth. Experiment informs us that the density of our
hardest rock is not above 2·8; but from the enormous
pressure to which matter must be subjected, at great
depths from the surface, the weight of the superincumbent
mass constantly increasing, it is quite certain
that the earth’s density must be far more than this.
Maskelyne determined the attraction of large masses
by a plummet and line on the mountain Schehallion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Cavendish, with exceedingly delicate apparatus, observed
the attraction of masses of known weight and size upon
each other. Applying the powers of arithmetical calculation,
and the data obtained from the small experiments
to the larger phenomena, Maskelyne determined
the earth’s mean density to be 4·71, whilst Cavendish
made it 5·48, but the more recent refined investigations
of Baily have determined it to be 5·67.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>From data thus obtained by severe inductive experiments
and mathematical analyses, the astronomer, by
observing the deviations of a distant star, is enabled to
determine the influence of those stellar bodies near
which it passes, and, hence, to calculate the relative
magnitudes of each. The accuracy of the law is in this
way put to the severest test, and the precision of astronomical
prediction is the strongest proof of its universality
and truth.</p>

<p>Rolling onward its lonely way, in the far immensity
of our system, the planet Uranus was discovered by
the elder Herschel,&mdash;so great its distance that its
diminished light could scarcely be detected by the
most powerful telescopes; but since its discovery its
path has been carefully watched, and some irregularities
noticed. Most of these disturbances were referable
to known causes; but a little alteration in its rate of
motion observed when the planet was in one portion
of its vast orbit was unexplained. Convinced of the
certainty of Newton’s law, and having determined
that the attraction of known masses was insufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
to produce the disturbance observed, these deviations
were referred to the gravitating influence of a mass
beyond the known limits of our Solar System. By
the investigations of Adams in England,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and Le Verrier
in France,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the place of the hypothetical mass was
determined, and its size computed. As a grand
confirmation of the great law, and to the glory of those
two far-searching minds, who do honour to their
respective countries and their age, the hypothesis
became a fact, in the discovery of the planet Neptune
in the place determined by rigorous calculation. Astronomy
affords other examples of the sublime truth of
the law of gravitation, than which science can afford no
more elevated poetry.</p>

<p>So completely is all nature locked in the bonds of
this infinite power, that it is no poetic exaggeration to
declare, that the blow which rends any earthly mass
is conveyed by successive impulses to every one of the
myriads of orbs, which are even too remote for the
reach of telescopic vision.</p>

<p>An illustrative experiment must close our consideration
of relative operations of rotation and gravitation. We well
know that a body in a fluid state would, if suspended above
the earth, it being at the same time free to take any form,
naturally assume that of a flattened spheroid, from the
action of the mass of the earth upon it: whereas the
force of cohesive attraction acting equally from all sides
of a centre, would, if uninfluenced, necessarily produce
a perfect sphere. The best method of showing that this
would be the case, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Alcohol and water are to be mixed together until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
fluid is of the same specific gravity as olive oil. If, when
this is effected, we drop globules of the oil into the
mixed fluid, it will be seen that they take an orbicular
form;&mdash;and, of course, in this experiment the power of
the earth’s gravitating influence is neutralized. The
same drops of oil under any other conditions would be
flattened. Simple as this illustration is, it tells much of
the wondrous secret of those beautifully balanced forces
of cohesion and of gravitation; and from the prosaic
fact we rise to a great philosophical truth. Our experiment
may lead us yet farther in exemplification of
known phenomena. If we pass a steel wire through
one of those floating spheres of oil, and make it revolve
rapidly and steadily, thus imitating the motion of a
planet on its axis, the oil spreads out, and we have the
spheroidal form of our earth. Increase the rapidity of
this rotation, and when a certain rate is obtained the
oil widens into a disc, a ring separates itself from
a central globe, and at a distance from it still revolves
around it.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Here we have a miniature representation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
the ring of Saturn. This is a suggestive experiment,
the repetition of which, by reflective minds, cannot fail
to lead to important deductions. The phenomena of
cohesion, of motion, and gravitation, are all involved;
and we produce results resembling, in a striking manner,
the conditions which prevail in the planetary spaces,
under the influence of the same powers. If we take
a glass globe, and having filled it with a fluid of the
proper density, drop into it large and small globules of
oil, we may produce an instructive representation of
the stellar vault, with its beautiful spheres of light
revolving in their respective orbits; and though crossing
each other’s paths, still moving in obedience to
attracting and repelling forces&mdash;onward in perfect
harmony.</p>

<p>From the centre of our earth to the utmost extremity
of the universe&mdash;from the infinitely small to the immensely
vast&mdash;gravitation exerts its force. It is met
on all sides by physical powers acting in antagonism to
it, but, like a ruling spirit, it restrains them in their
wildest moods.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Three hypotheses may be used to account for this most curious
phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
1st. The body shines by its own light, and then explodes like a
sky-rocket, breaking into minute fragments too small to be any
longer visible to the naked eye.
</p>
<p>
2nd. Such a body, having shone by its own light, suddenly
ceases to be luminous. “The falling stars and other fiery meteors
which are frequently seen at a considerable height in the atmosphere,
and which have received different names according to the
variety of their figure and size, arise from the fermentation of the
effluvia of acid and alkaline bodies which float in the atmosphere.
When the more subtile parts of the effluvia are burned away, the
viscous and earthy parts become too heavy for the air to support,
and by their gravity fall to the earth.”&mdash;Keith’s <i>Use of the Globes</i>.
According to Sir Humphry Davy, in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1847, “the luminous appearances of shooting stars and
meteors cannot be owing to any inflammation of elastic fluids, but
must depend upon the ignition of solid bodies.”
</p>
<p>
3. The body shines by the reflected light of the sun, and ceases
to be visible by its passing into the earth’s shadow, or, in other
words, is eclipsed. Upon the two former suppositions the fact of
the star’s disappearance conveys to us no knowledge of its position,
or of its distance from the earth; and all that can be said is, that
if it be a satellite of the earth, the great rapidity of its motion involves
the necessity of its being at no great distance from the earth’s
surface&mdash;much nearer than the moon; while the resistance it
would encounter in traversing the air would be so great that it is
probably without the limits of our atmosphere. <i>Sir J. W. Lubbock
leans to the third hypothesis.</i>&mdash;Sir J. W. Lubbock, <i>On Shooting
Stars</i>: Phil. Mag. No. 213, p. 81.
</p>
<p>
Sir J. Lubbock also published a supplementary paper on the
same subject, in No. 214, p. 170.
</p>
<p>
Mr. J. P. Joule entertains an hypothesis with respect to Shooting
Stars similar to that advocated by Chladni to account for meteoric
stones, and he reckons the ignition of these miniature planetary
bodies by their violent collision with our atmosphere, to be a remarkable
illustration of the doctrine of the equivalency of heat to
mechanical power, or <i>vis viva</i>.
</p>
<p>
If we suppose a meteoric stone of the size of a six-inch cube to
enter our atmosphere at the rate of eighteen miles per second of
time, the atmosphere being 1/100 of its density at the earth’s surface,
the resistance offered to the motion of the stone will in this case
be at least 51,600 lbs.; and if the stone traverse twenty miles with
this amount of resistance, sufficient heat will thereby be developed
to give 1° Fahrenheit to 6,967,980 lbs. of water. Of course by far
the largest portion of this heat will be given to the displaced air,
every particle of which will sustain the shock, whilst only the surface
of the stone will be in violent collision with the atmosphere.
Hence the stone may be considered as placed in a blast of intensely
heated air, the heat being communicated from the surface to the
centre by conduction. Only a small portion of the heat evolved
will therefore be received by the stone; but if we estimate it at
only 1/100 it will still be equal to 1° Fahrenheit per 69,679 lbs. of
water, a quantity quite equal to the melting and dissipation of any
materials of which it may be composed.&mdash;Mr. J. P. Joule, <i>On Shooting
Stars</i>: Phil. Mag. No. 216, p. 348.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> “Laplace conjectures that in the original condition of the solar
system, the sun revolved upon his axis, surrounded by an atmosphere
which, in virtue of an excessive heat, extended far beyond
the orbits of all the planets, the planets as yet having no existence.
The heat gradually diminished, and as the solar atmosphere contracted
by cooling, the rapidity of its rotation increased by the laws
of rotatory motion; and an exterior zone of vapour was detached
from the rest, the central attraction being no longer able to overcome
the increased centrifugal force. This zone of vapour might
in some cases retain its form, as we see it in Saturn’s ring; but
more usually the ring of vapour would break into several masses,
and these would generally coalesce into one mass, which would revolve
about the sun,”&mdash;Whewell’s <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>.
</p>
<p>
The following passage is translated by the same author from
Laplace:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“The anterior state (a state of cloudy brightness) was itself preceded
by other states, in which the nebulous matter was more and
more diffuse, the nucleus being less and less luminous. We arrive
in this manner at a nebulosity so diffuse, that its existence could
scarce be suspected. Such is in fact the first state of the nebula
which Herschel carefully observed by means of his telescope.”
</p>
<p>
Sir William Herschel has the following observations on these
remarkable masses:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“The nature of planetary nebulæ, which has hitherto been involved
in much darkness, may now be explained with some degree
of satisfaction, since the uniform and very considerable brightness
of their apparent disc accords remarkably well with a much condensed,
luminous fluid; whereas, to suppose them to consist of
clustering stars will not so completely account for the milkiness or
soft tint of their light, to produce which it would be required that
the condensation of the stars should be carried to an almost inconceivable
degree of accumulation.
</p>
<p>
“How far the light that is perpetually emitted from millions of
suns may be concerned in this shining fluid, it might be presumptuous
to attempt to determine; but notwithstanding the inconceivable
subtilty of the particles of light, when the number of the
emitting bodies is almost infinitely great, and the time of the continual
emission indefinitely long, the quantity of emitted particles
may well become adequate to the constitution of a shining fluid or
luminous matter, provided a cause can be found that may retain
them from <i>flying off, or reunite them</i>.”&mdash;<i>Observations on Nebulous
Stars</i>: Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxxxi. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1791.

principles which appear to embrace the best possible conditions
for obtaining a reflecting surface which should reflect the greatest
quantity of light, and retain that property little diminished for a
length of time. The alloy used for this purpose consists of tin and
copper in atomic proportions, namely, one atom of tin to four atoms
of copper, or by weight 58·9 to 126·4.&mdash;<i>On the Construction of

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The best description of the Zodiacal Light occurs in a letter
furnished by Sir John Herschel to the <i>Times</i> newspaper in March,
1843:&mdash;“The zodiacal light, as its name imports, invariably appears
in the zodiac, or, to speak more precisely, in the plane of the
sun’s equator, which is 7° inclined to the zodiac, and which plane,
seen from the sun, intersects the ecliptic in longitude 78° and 258°,
or so much in advance of the equinoctial points: in consequence
it is seen to the best advantage at, or a little after, the equinoxes;
after sunset, at the spring, and before sunrise, at the autumnal
equinox; not only because the direction of its apparent axis lies
at those times more nearly perpendicular to the horizon, but also
because at those epochs we are approaching the situation when it
is seen most completely in section.
</p>
<p>
“At the vernal equinox the appearance of the zodiacal light is
that of a pretty broad pyramidal, or rather lenticular, body of light,
which begins to be visible as soon as the twilight decays. It is
very bright at its lower or broader part near the horizon, and, if
there be broken clouds about, often appears like the glow of a distant
conflagration, or of the rising moon, only less red, giving rise,
in short, to amorphous masses of light such as have been noticed
by one of your correspondents as possibly appertaining to the comet.
At higher altitudes, its light fades gradually, and is seldom traceable
much beyond the Pleiades, which it usually, however, attains
and involves, and (what is most to my present purpose) its axis at
the vernal equinox is always inclined (to the northward of the
equator) at an angle of between 60° and 70° to the horizon, and it
is most luminous at its base, resting on the horizon, where also it
is broadest, occupying, in fact, an angular breadth of somewhere
about 10° or 12° in ordinary clear weather.”</p></div>

Memoir by M. Mädler, <i>Die Centralsonne</i>. The conclusions arrived
at by Mädler may be understood from the following quotation from
a French translation, made by M. A. Gautier, in the <i>Archives des
Sciences Physiques et Naturelles</i>, for October, 1846:&mdash;“Quoiqu’il
résulte de ce qui précède que la région du ciel que j’ai adoptée
satisfait à toutes les conditions posées plus haut, il n’en est pas
moins convenable de la soumettre à toutes les épreuves possibles.
Plusieurs essais de combinaisons différentes m’ont convaincu qu’on
ne pourrait trouver aucun autre point dans le ciel qui pût tenir
lieu, même d’une manière approchée, que celui que j’ai adopté.
On pourrait maintenant m’addresser l’objection que, si la région
du ciel où se trouve le centre de gravité de notre système d’étoiles
fixes, est <span class="correction" title="In the original book: determinée">déterminée</span> par ce qui précède entre certaines limites, il
n’en résulte pas la nécessité de choisir Alcyone pour ce centre,
attendu qu’il pourrait bien tomber sur quelqu’autre étoile située
dans le groupe ou dans son voisinage. Mais outre que c’est tout
près de là que se trouve le groupe le plus brillant et le plus riche
en étoiles de tout le ciel, et qu’il ne s’agit point ici d’un point
arbitraire situé dans le voisinage peu apparent et qui n’ait rien
qui le distingue, il ne se trouve nul part, même dans la région
voisine, une aussi exacte concordance des mouvements propres
qu’ici, et ces mouvements correspondent mieux que tous les autres
aux conditions établies plus haut. Or si l’on doit considérer ce
groupe central, entre les étoiles également éloignées, on peut présumer
que la plus brillante de beaucoup présente la plus grande
masse. Outre cela Alcyone, considérée optiquement, est au milieu
du groupe des Pleïades; et son mouvement propre, déterminé par
Bessel, est plus exactement en accord avec la moyenne de ceux
des autres Pleïades; ainsi que des étoiles de cette région jusqu’à
10° de distance. <i>Je puis donc établir comme conséquence de tout ce
qui précède, que le groupe des Pleïades est le groupe <span class="correction" title="In the original book: central l’ensemble">central de l’ensemble</span>
du système des étoiles fixes, jusqu’aux limites extérieures déterminées
par la Voie Lactée; et que Alcyone est l’étoile de ce groupe qui
paraît être, le plus vraisemblablement, le vrai Soleil central.</i>”</p></div>

filters, care being taken to cover the funnels containing these last
with plates of glass; this precaution is taken in order to prevent,
as much as possible, the evaporation of the alcohol. The alcoholic
liquor passes the first through the filters, ordinarily carrying
with it a certain number of very minute spherules of oil When
the greater part has thus passed, the spherules become more numerous;
what still remains in the first filters, namely, the oil and a
residue of alcoholic liquor, is then thrown into a single filter placed
on a new flask. This last filtration takes place much more slowly
than the first, on account of the viscosity of the oil; it is considerably
accelerated by renewing the filter once or twice during the
operation. If the funnel has been covered with sufficient care, the
oil will collect into a single mass at the bottom of the flask <span class="correction" title="In the original book: unde">under</span>

<p class="p2">In contemplating the works of nature, we cannot but
regard, with feelings of religious admiration, the infinite
variety of forms under which matter is presented to our
senses. On every hand the utmost diversity is exhibited;
through all things we trace the most perfect
order; and over all is diffused the charm of beauty. It
is the uneducated or depraved alone who find deformities
in the creations by which we are surrounded.</p>

<p>The three conditions of matter are&mdash;the solid, the
fluid, and the aëriform; and these belong equally to the
organic and the inorganic world.</p>

<p>In organic nature we have an almost infinite variety
of animal form, presenting developments widely different
from each other, yet in every case suited to the circumstances
required by the position which the creature,
occupies in the scale of being. Through the entire
series, from the Polype to the higher order of animals,
even to man, we find a uniformity in the progress
towards perfection, and a continuity in the series, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
betrays the great secret, that the mystery of life is the
same in all,&mdash;a pervading spiritual essence associated
with matter, and modifying it by the master-mechanism
of an Infinite mind.</p>

<p>In the vegetable clothing of the surface of the earth,
which fits it for the abode of man and animals&mdash;from
the confervæ of a stagnant pool, or the lichen of the
wind-beaten rocks, to the lordly oak or towering palm&mdash;a
singularly beautiful chain of being presents itself to
the contemplative mind, and we cannot but trace
the gradual elevation in the scale of organization.</p>

<p>In the inorganic world, where the great phenomena
of life are wanting, we have constantly exhibited the
working of powers of a strangely complicated kind.
The symmetrical arrangement of crystals&mdash;the diversified
characters of mineral formations&mdash;the systematic
aggregations of particles to form masses possessing properties
of a peculiar and striking nature&mdash;all prove, that
agencies, which science, with all its refinements, has not
yet detected, are unceasingly at work. Heat, electricity,
chemical power&mdash;whatever that may be&mdash;and the forces
of cohesion, are known to be involved in the production
of the forms we see; but contemplation soon leads to
the conviction that these powers are subordinate to
others which we know not of. We know only the
things belonging to the surface of our planet, and these
but superficially. The geologist traces rock-formations
succeeding each other (from the primary strata
holding no traces of organized forms, through the Paleozoic
series, in which, step by step, the history of animal
life is recorded,) to the more recent formations, teeming
with relics, which, though allied to some animal types
still existing, are generally such as have passed away.
The naturalist searches the earth, the waters, and the
air, for their living things; and the diversity of form,
the variety of condition, and the perfection of organization
which he discovers as belonging to this our epoch&mdash;differing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
from, indeed bearing but a slight relation to,
those which mark the earth’s mutations&mdash;exhibit, in a
most striking view, the endless variety of characters
which matter can assume.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to all these phenomena of
matter, that it is with some difficulty we can bend
ourselves to the study of the more simple conditions
in which it exists.</p>

<p>The solid crusts of this telluric sphere&mdash;the waters
and the atmosphere&mdash;the diversified fabrics of the vegetable
kingdom&mdash;and the still more complicated structures
of men and animals&mdash;are, altogether, but the
aggregation of minute particles in accordance with
certain fixed laws. By mechanical means all kinds of
matter may be reduced to powder, the fine particles of
which would not appear very different from each other,
but each atom has been impressed with properties
peculiar to itself, which man has no power to change.</p>

<p>To nature alone belongs the mysterious property of
transmutation. The enthusiastic alchemist, by the
agency of physical forces, dissipates a metal in vapour;
but it remains a metal, and the same metal still. By the
Hermetic art he breaks up the combination of masses;
but he cannot alter the principles of any one of the
elements which form the mass upon which his skill is
tried.</p>

<p>Every atom is invested with properties peculiar to all
of its class; and each one possesses powers, to which in
mute obedience it is compelled, by which these properties
are modified, and the character of matter varied.
What are those properties? Do we know anything of
those powers?</p>

<p>The earth, so far as we are acquainted with it, is
composed of about sixty principles, which we call
elementary. These are the most simple states to which
we can reduce matter, and from them all the forms of
creation yet examined by the chemist are produced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
These elementary principles are, some of them, permanently
gaseous under the ordinary temperature, and
others exist as solid masses; the difference between the
two conditions being regulated, as it appears, by the
opposing forces of heat and cohesive attraction.</p>

<p>Matter has been regarded by some as infinitely divisible;
but the known conditions of chemical combinations
lead to the conclusion that there are limits beyond
which matter cannot be divided.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The theory of atoms
having determinate characters, and possessing symmetric
forms, certainly has the advantage of presenting to the
human mind a starting point&mdash;a sort of standing ground,&mdash;from
which it can direct the survey of cosmical phenomena.
The metaphysical hypothesis, which resolves
all matter into properties, and refers all things to ideas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
leaves the mind in a state of uncertainty and bewilderment.</p>

<p>Adapting the views of Dumas, with some modifications,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
it will be found more satisfactory to regard the
<i>ultimate atoms</i> of matter as points beyond the reach of
our examination; which, according to a law, determined
by the influences of the so-called imponderable forces,
unite to form <i>molecules</i>. Again, these molecules combine
to form the <i>particles</i> of the mass which we may
regard as the limit of mechanical division. The particles
of solid bodies are solid, those of fluids fluid, and those of
gaseous bodies are themselves aëriform; but it does not
follow that the molecules of any body should be neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>sarily
solid, fluid, or aëriform, from the circumstance of
their having formed the particles of a body in one of
these states.</p>

<p>As this planet&mdash;a molecule in space&mdash;is formed of
aggregated atoms, and enveloped by its own physical
agencies&mdash;and as it is involved in the infinitely extending
influences of other planetary molecules, and thus forms
part of a system&mdash;so the molecules of any mass are
grouped into a system or particle, which possesses the
great characteristic features of the whole.</p>

<p>In an aëriform body the particles are in a state of
extreme tenuity, the molecules being themselves, by the
influence of some repulsive force, just on the verge where
cohesion exerts its decaying power. In fluid bodies the
attenuation of the particles is less&mdash;the particles and
also the molecules are nearer together,&mdash;whereas, in the
solid body, the forces of cohesion are most strongly exerted,
and all the molecular conditions brought more
powerfully into action.</p>

<p>Under the term molecular force, we include several
agencies,&mdash;not alike in the phenomena which they
exhibit, but which are all-powerful in producing the
general characteristics of bodies. These require a
somewhat close examination. All the particles of even
a solid mass may be brought under conditions on which
they are free to move. By heat we can increase the
length and thickness of a bar of iron, or any other
metal, and at length produce the fluid state,&mdash;a melted
metal flows as freely as water in a stream. Fluids,
and gases in like manner obey the dispersive influence
of caloric. From these and other analogous results we
learn that all bodies have a greater or less degree of
porosity. The distance at which the particles of fluid
bodies are maintained is strikingly proved by the fact,
that hydrated salts dissolved in water occupy no more
space than that which is equal to the water contained in
the crystalline body; while anhydrous salts dissolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
without at all increasing the bulk of the fluid. All the
solid matter of the salt must, in these cases, it would
appear, go to fill up the interstitial spaces which we
suppose to exist in the liquid.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The conditions which regulate the solubility of
bodies, and the power of solution, regarded either as a
mechanical or a chemical process, are very obscure.
We might be led to suppose, that those bodies possessing
the largest amount of unoccupied space were capable
of holding the greatest quantity of soluble matter dissolved.
This, however, is far from being the case, the
denser fluids generally having the greatest solvent
power.</p>

<p>The peculiar manner in which hydrogen gas appears
to dissolve solid substances,&mdash;as iron, potassium, sodium,
sulphur, phosphorus, selenium, and arsenic, may be explained
by regarding the results as a manifestation
of the powers of chemical affinity over the forms of
bodies. In like manner, the solution of salt in water,
or the mixture of alcohol in that fluid, may be viewed as
chemical phenomena, although usually considered as
simple cases of solution or mixture: alterations of temperature
and other physical changes taking place in either. If
two masses of metal,&mdash;either tin and copper, for example,&mdash;are
melted and combined, the united mass will not
equal the bulk of the two masses. If a pint measure of
oil of vitriol and an equal quantity of water are mixed
together, the combined fluids will not fill a two pint
measure.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span></p>
<p>In these instances a large quantity of heat is rendered
sensible, as if it had been squeezed out by the force
with which the particles combined, from <span class="correction" title="In the original book: insterstices">interstices</span>,
which were filled with, what we may be allowed to call,
an atmosphere of heat. Hence we conclude that,
amongst the influences determining the molecular constitution
of a body, heat performs an important part.
All these facts go to prove that the atoms which form
the compound body, whatever may be its character, are
disposed of as so many centres of force, which act by
influences of a peculiar character upon each other. That
these influences are dependent upon known physical
forces is certain; but the laws by which the powers of
the ultimate atom are altered remain still unknown.</p>

<p>In the great operations of nature, changes are produced
which we cannot understand, and variations of
condition do certainly occur, which may be regarded as
instances of transmutation.</p>

<p>Amongst others, we may adduce the different states
in which we know carbon to exist. We have the
diamond with its beautiful light-refracting property, its
hardness and high specific gravity, capable of being converted
into graphite and coke.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Charcoal, graphite, and
the diamond, are totally unlike each other, yet we know
they are each composed of the same atoms. Charcoal
is a black irregular substance, light, and readily inflammable;
graphite is crystallizable; but the forms of its
crystals cannot be referred to those of the diamond, and
it burns with difficulty. The diamond occurs in the
most regular and beautifully transparent forms; and it
can be burned only at the highest artificial temperatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
We are, however, convinced by experiment that the
brilliant and transparent gem is made up of the same
atoms as those which go to form the dull black mass of
charcoal. From diamonds, as is above stated, coke has
been formed by the heat of the voltaic battery, and recent
experiments have proved that the volatilized
carbon constantly passing off from one of the poles of a
sufficiently powerful battery, is deposited in a crystalline
powder, possessing most of the properties, as it
regards hardness, &amp;c. of true diamond dust. What is
the mystery of this? We know not. The peculiar
conditions have been the subjects of anxious study; but
science has not yet let in a ray of light upon the
mystery. That a different state&mdash;it has been called
an <i>allotropic</i> condition&mdash;is often induced in the same
class of atoms is certain; and hence the variety of the
resulting compounds. To continue our illustrations
with carbon&mdash;may not its combinations, in uniform proportions
with oxygen and hydrogen,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> owe their differences
to some allotropic change in the ultimate atoms of
this element.</p>

<p>We know that silicon&mdash;the metallic base of flint&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
capable of assuming two or more different states; and
that sulphur, selenium, phosphorus, and arsenic, are
susceptible of these remarkable changes in which, without
the slightest variation in the chemical character, a
complete change in the physical condition is produced.
Copper, iron, tin, and manganese, are known to exist in
at least two states of physical dissimilarity, and many of
the rarer metals exhibit the same peculiarity.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Hence,
may we not infer that some of those substances, which
we now term elementary, are but altered conditions of
the same element? The resemblance between many of
those bodies strengthens the supposition. Iridium and
platinum,&mdash;iron and nickel,&mdash;chlorine, bromine, iodine,
and probably fluorine,&mdash;are good examples of these
similarities, although these bodies are all distinguished
by physical and chemical differences.</p>

<p>The light-refracting gem, which glistens on the neck
of beauty, and is valued for its transparency, differs only
from the rude lump of coke in its molecular arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>ment.
Chemistry teaches us that we may, without producing
any disarrangement of the affinities, but by
merely setting up molecular disturbance, effect decided
changes, as is strikingly shown in the colour of iodide of
mercury changing from red to yellow under slight influences
of heat, and back again to red by a gentle
mechanical disturbance. By a slight change, merely
molecular, iron may be made to resemble platinum in
its physical properties.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> An iron wire plunged into
nitric acid is attacked by the acid with violence; but if
one extremity of the wire is heated in the flame of
a spirit lamp, such a change of state is produced
throughout the entire length of the wire, that if it be
now plunged into nitric acid no effect is produced upon
it. On studying this question, we find good reason for
supposing that bodies which, though physically different,
resemble each other in some of their properties, iodine,
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: bromime">bromine</span>, &amp;c., are the results of different <i>allotropic</i> conditions
which have been impressed upon the ultimate
atoms, similar to those observed in the substances
named. This hypothesis appears to be more in accordance

guided the labours of an Infinite Mind, than that which
supposes a vast number of individual creations. It will
be seen in the sequel that light, heat, electricity, and
chemical action, have the power of producing yet more
striking changes in the forms of bodies. Is it not
probable that, according to the operations of these
agents, either combined or separate, acting over different
spaces of time, and under varying circumstances, in
relation to the molecular forces, all those <i>allotropic</i>
states may be produced? Hence bodies may be discovered,
which,&mdash;from the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: imperfectious">imperfections</span> of science,&mdash;resisting
our means of analysis, must, for a time, be
regarded as new elements, whereas they are possibly
only altered states of the same substance.</p>

<p>The experiments of Faraday and of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Plucker">Plücker</span> prove
that all matter exists in certain polar conditions, having
powers of mutual attraction and repulsion.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Are the
molecular forces, so called, to be referred to any of those
powers which are involved in the general term magnetic-polarity?
Are they not probably the result of some
ultimate principle of which these properties are but
the modified manifestations? These questions will
now be generally answered in favour of magnetism;
but in our ignorance we should pause; the next genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>tion
will without doubt find another solution for
the problem.</p>

<p>Franklin supposed the ultimate atoms of bodies to be
surrounded by a subtile fluid or ether, which they have
the power of condensing upon their surfaces with
great force&mdash;and we have experiments showing that
this is probable<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;whilst he regarded the atoms of the
ether itself as mutually repellent, thus establishing an
equilibrium of forces. Æpinus reduced the hypothesis
of Franklin to a mathematical theory; and Coulomb
<i>proved</i> that the force with which the repulsion of the
ethereal atoms and the attraction of the material molecules
are produced, is, like universal attraction,&mdash;to
whatever power that may be due,&mdash;regulated by the law
of the inverse ratio of the square of the distance. These
views are found, upon minute examination, to hold true
to the phenomena with which inductive science has
made us acquainted; and the striking manner in which,
when submitted to the rigorous investigations of geometers,
they agree with known conditions of electricity,
appears certainly to favour the opinion that this power
may be materially connected with these molecular
arrangements.</p>

<p>Many of the phenomena which are connected with
the magnetic influences also bear in a remarkable
manner upon this inquiry. But, without the necessary
proof of direct experimental evidence, it were as unphilosophical
to refer the binding together of the
molecules of matter to the agency of electricity, as it
would be to adopt the theory of the hooked atoms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
Epicurus, or the astrological dream of the sympathies of
matter.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Science, however, enables us to infer with safety that
the mechanical powers which regulate the constitution
of a cube of marble, or a granite mountain, are of a
similar order to those which determine the earth’s relation
to the other planets in the solar system, and that
solar system itself a unit, in the immensity of space, to
the myriads of suns which spangle the stellar vault.</p>

<p>In fine, cohesion, or the attraction of aggregation, is
a power employed in binding particle to particle. To
cohesion, we find we have heat opposed as a repellent
force; and the mysterious operations of those electrical
phenomena, generally referred to as polar forces, are
constantly, it is certain, interfering with its powers. In
addition, we have seen that in nature there exists an
agency which is capable of changing the constitution of
the ultimate atoms, and of thus giving variety to each
resulting mass. What this power may be, our science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
cannot tell; but our reason leads us, with firm conviction,
to the belief that it is a principle which is,
beyond all others in its subtile influences which equally
universal with, appears to rise superior to gravitation;
and which, like a spirituality, shadows forth to our
dwarf conceptions the immensity of the divine power of
the omniscient Creator.</p>

<p>The molecular forces involve a consideration of all the
known physical powers, the study of which, in their
operations on matter, will engage our attention. But it
is pleasant to learn, as we advance step by step in our
examination of the phenomena of creation, that we may
study the grand in what externally appears the simple,
and learn, in the mysteries of a particle, the high
truths which science has to tell of a planet.</p>

<p>It may appear that the forces of gravitation and cohesion
are regarded as identical. Many phenomena, which
we are enabled to reach by the refinements of inductive
inquiry, certainly present to us a striking similarity in
the laws which regulate the operations of these powers;
but it must be remembered that their identity is not
established. So far from this, we know the law of gravitating
force. Newton determined with surprising
accuracy, that the action of this power diminishes with
the distance as the universe square, but cohesive force is
exerted only at such distances that it is impossible to
determine whether or not it is subjected to the same law.
To quote the words of Young: “The whole of our
inquiries respecting the intimate nature of forces of any
kind must be considered merely as speculative amusements,
which are of no further utility than as they
make our views more general, and assist our experimental
investigations.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

imagination, but we have no reason for asserting that it is
infinite; for the demonstrations which have sometimes been
adduced in favour of this opinion are obviously applicable to
space only. The infinite divisibility of space seems to be essential
to the conception that we have of its nature, and it may be
strictly demonstrated that it is mathematically possible to draw
an infinite number of circles between any given circle and its
tangent, none of which shall touch either of them except at the
general point of contact; and that a ship following always the
same oblique course with respect to the meridian,&mdash;for example,
sailing north-eastwards,&mdash;would continue perpetually to approach
the pole without ever completely reaching it. But when we
inquire into the truth of the old maxim of the schools, that all
matter is infinitely divisible, we are by no means able to decide
so positively. Newton observes that it is doubtful whether any
human means may be sufficient to separate the particles of
matter beyond a certain limit; and it is not impossible that
there may be some constitution of atoms, or single corpuscles,
on which their properties, as matter, depend, and which would
be destroyed if the units were further divided; but it appears to
be more probable that there are no such atoms, and even if there
are, it is almost certain that matter is never thus annihilated in
the common course of matter.”&mdash;<i>The Essential Properties of

the nature of matter, or the mode of its formation; the
one known as the <i>atomic</i> theory, the other, the <i>dynamic</i>. The
founder of the former and earlier was Leucippus: he considered
the basis of all bodies to be extremely fine particles,
differing in form and nature, which he supposed to be dispersed
through space, and to which his follower Epicurus first gave
the name of atoms. To these atoms he attributed a rectilinear
motion, in consequence of which such as are homogeneous
united, whilst the lighter were dispersed through space. The
author of the second hypothesis was the famous Kant. He
imagined all matter existed, or was originated, by two antagonist
and mutually counteracting principles, which he called attraction
and repulsion, all the predicates of which he referred to motion.
Most modern philosophers, and foremost amongst them Ampère
and Poisson, have adopted an hypothesis combining the features
of both the preceding. They regarded the atoms as data, deriving
their origin from the Deity as the first cause, and consider their
innate attractive and repulsive force as a necessary condition to
their combination in bodies. The main features of this hypothesis
are borrowed from Aristotle, inasmuch as he supposed the basis
of all bodies to be the four elements known to the ancients, the
particles of which, endued with certain powers, constituted
bodies. According to Ampère, all bodies consist of equal particles,
and they again of molecules that, up to a certain distance,
attract each other. Their distance from each other he supposed
to be regulated by the intensity of the attractive and repulsive
forces, the latter of which preponderates.”&mdash;Peschel’s <i>Elements of
Physics</i>; translated by E. West, 1845.</p></div>

redness, on exposure to air soon becomes converted throughout
its mass into protoxide; and when it is triturated for some time
with an equivalent quantity of sulphur, it combines with it
according to Böttcher’s experiments, producing flame, and forming
sulphuret of copper. If, however, the copper be reduced by
hydrogen at a red heat, still considerably below the temperature
at which it softens and begins to melt, it remains for years unchanged
by exposure to air, and cannot be made to combine
with sulphur without the application of heat. Iron, cobalt, and
nickel, when reduced by hydrogen below a red heat, inflame after
they have cooled, if exposed to the air; and if they are immediately
placed in water to avoid their taking fire, they inflame
when they are again removed, and have become nearly dry. If
we compare this behaviour with that of iron reduced by heat,
and with iron in that state in which it forms the conductor of
a galvanic current without becoming oxidized, it would appear
that these peculiarities depended upon something more than a
difference of mechanical condition.”&mdash;<i>Berzelius on the Allotropy

<p class="p2">“Crystallisation is a peculiar and most admirable
work of nature’s geometry, worthy of being studied
by all the power of genius, and the whole energy of the
mind, not on account of the delight which always
attends the knowledge of wonders, but because of its
vast importance in revealing to us the secrets of nature;
for here she does, as it were, betray herself, and, laying
aside all disguise, permits us to behold, not merely the
results of her operations, but the very processes <span class="correction" title="In the original book: themselvss">themselves</span>.”&mdash;Such
is the language of an Italian philosopher,
Gulielmini; and it is the striking peculiarity of beholding
the process of the formation of the regular geometric
figures of crystals, the gradual accretion of particle to
particle, which induces us to separate crystallization from
mere molecular aggregation. Without doubt the formation
of a crystal and the production of an amorphous
block are due to powers which bear a close resemblance
in many points; but they present remarkable differences
in others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Let us take some simple case in illustration. In
quiet water we have very finely divided matter suspended,
and matter in a state of solution. The first is
slowly precipitated, and in process of time consolidates
into a hard mass at the bottom, presenting no particular
character, unless it has been placed in some peculiar
physical conditions; when, as in nature, we have a
regular bedding which is intersected by lines of lamination
or of cleavage, which we are, from experiment,
enabled to refer to the influence of current electricity.
The second&mdash;the matter in solution&mdash;is also slowly
deposited; but it is accumulated upon nuclei which
possess some peculiar disposing powers, and every particle
is united by some particular face, and an angular
figure of the most perfect character results. Many
pleasing experiments would appear to show that electricity
has much to do in the process of crystallization;
but it is evident that it must be under some peculiarly
modified conditions that this power is exerted, if, indeed,
it has any direct action.</p>

<p>The same substances always crystallize in the same
forms, unless the conditions of the crystallizing body are
altered. It has been supposed that each particle of a
crystalline mass has certain points or poles which possess
definite properties, and that cohesion takes place only
along lines which have some relation to the attracting
or repelling powers of these poles. We shall have,
eventually, to consider results which appear to prove
that magnetism is universal in its influence, and that
this polarity of the particles of matter may be referred
to it.</p>

<p>Be the cause of crystallisation what it may, it presents
to us in appearance a near approach in inorganic nature
to some of the peculiar conditions of growth in the
organised creation. In one, we have the gradual production
of parts and the formation of members due to
peculiar powers of assimilation, each individual pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>serving
all its distinguishing features; and in the other,
we have a regular order of cohesion occurring under the
influence of a power which draws like to like, and
arranges the whole into a form of beauty.</p>

<p>This appears to be the proper place for correcting an
error too prevalent, relative to the formation of crystals,
the development of cells, and the yet more fatal falsehood
of referring the great phenomena of Life to any
of the physical forces with which we are acquainted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Crystal</span> <i>forms</i>, by the accretion of particle to
particle, along lines determined by some yet unknown
power. There is no change in the character of any
particle&mdash;like coheres to like; the first atom and the
last of the series being identical in character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Plant</span> <i>grows</i>, not by the gathering together of
similar particles of matter, but by the absorption of a
compound particle&mdash;by that one which must be regarded
as the primary nuclear atom or cell. After this absorption&mdash;in
virtue of a power which we call <span class="smcap">life</span>, excited into
action by <span class="smcap">light</span>&mdash;the compound particle is decomposed,
and one constituent is retained to effect the formation
of a new cell, whilst the other is liberated as an invisible
air. Here we have a change of chemical constitution
effected; and this takes place through the whole period
of vegetable growth, from the development of the plumule
up to the formation of the latest leaf upon the
topmost branch of the most lordly tree.</p>

<p>Life has been referred to electricity and to chemical
power&mdash;as the effect of a known cause. Without doubt,
during the operations of life the whole of the physical
powers are necessary to the production of all the phenomena
of growth in the vegetable and the animal world.
But these powers are ever subsidiary to vital force, and
are like attendant spirits chained to do an enchanter’s
bidding.</p>

<p>Life is a force beyond the reach of human search, and
he who fancies he has a hold upon the principle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
produced biological phenomena, has committed himself
to as wild a pursuit as he who rashly endeavours to catch
a morass-meteor.</p>

<p>Subtile as are the forces of light, heat, and electricity&mdash;that
of life, <i>vitality</i>, is infinitely more refined, and it
must for ever elude the search of the philosopher.</p>

<p>Man is permitted to test and try all things which are
created, and to apply to useful ends the discoveries which
he may make. But man can never become a creator;
and he who would attempt to give sense to an inert mass
of matter, by electricity, heat, or light, will prove himself
as ignorant of nature’s truth as is the senseless mass
upon which he works.</p>

<p>“So far shalt thou go, and no further,” was said
equally to the great tide-wave of human intellect, as to
the mighty surge of the earth-girdling ocean.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that a striking difference
exists between the productions of the mineral and the
other kingdoms of nature. Animals and vegetables arrive
at maturity by successive developments, and increase by
the assimilation of substances, having the power of producing
the most important chemical changes upon such
matter as comes within the range of their influence; but
minerals are equally perfect in the earliest stages of their
formation, and increase only, as previously said, by the
accretion of particles without their undergoing any
change.</p>

<p>The animal and vegetable tribes cease to continue the
functions of life: death ensues, and a complete disorganisation
takes place; but this is not the case in the
mineral world: the crystal being the result of a constantly
acting force is not necessarily liable to decomposition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we sometimes find in nature that crystals,
after arriving at what may be regarded as, in some
sort, their maturity, are, owing to a change of the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>ditions
under which they were formed, gradually decomposed.
In our mines we discover skeletons of crystals,
and within the hollow shell thus formed, other crystals
of a different constitution and figure find nuclei, and the
conditions required for their development. Again, to
give a striking instance, the felspar crystals of the
granitic formations are liable to decomposition in a
somewhat peculiar manner. In decomposing, these
crystals leave moulds of their own peculiar forms, and it
not unfrequently happens, in the stanniferous districts
of Cornwall, that oxide of tin gradually fills these moulds,
and we procure this metallic mineral in the form of the
earthy one. Then we have the curious instances of
bodies crystallising in a false form under change of circumstances.
We find, for example, Pseudomorphism, (or
<i>false-form</i>), as this class of phenomena is named, occurring
by the removal of the constituent atoms of one
crystal, while another set&mdash;which naturally assumes a
different form&mdash;takes their place, yet still preserving
the original shape. It often happens that copper pyrites
will, in this manner, exhibit the angles of an ordinary
variety of crystallised carbonate of iron. These curious
changes may be familiarised by supposing a beautiful
statue of gold, from which some skilful mechanic removes
particle by particle, and so skilfully substitutes a grain of
brass for every one of gold removed, that the loss of the
precious metal cannot be detected by any mere examination
of its form.</p>

<p>Crystalline form is not strictly dependent upon the
chemical nature of the parts forming the crystal. The
same number of atoms, arranged in the same way, produce
the same form. Substances much unlike each
other will assume the same crystalline arrangement.

iron, nickel, and cobalt, combined with the same acid,
present similarly formed bodies. These Isomorphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
(<i>like-form</i>)<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> peculiarities are exceedingly common, and
the discoverer of the phenomena, Mitscherlich, announced
the above law. It cannot, however, be regarded
as a philosophical expression of the fact, and requires
reconsideration&mdash;chemical elements of a dissimilar character
may have the same law of aggregation, and thus
produce the same form, without having any relation to
the number of atoms.</p>

<p>We also find compounds which have two distinct
systems of crystallisation. This property, Dimorphism,
is very strikingly shown in carbonate of lime, which
occurs in rhombohedrons, in calc spar, and in rhombic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
prisms in arragonite. The molecular arrangements here
are not, however, of equal stability, and one form is
evidently forced upon the other, and is abandoned by it
on the slightest disturbance. When a prism of arragonite
is heated it breaks up into the rhombs of common
calc spar, at a temperature far below that at which the
carbonate of lime is decomposed; but no alteration of
temperature can convert calc spar into arragonite.</p>

<p>Crystals are found in the most microscopic character,
and of an exceedingly large size. A crystal of quartz at
Milan is three feet and a quarter long, and five feet and
a half in circumference, and its weight is 870 pounds.
Beryls have been found in New Hampshire measuring
four feet in length.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In the dark recesses of the earth, where the influences
which produce organisation and life cease to act, a
creative spirit still pursues its never-ending task of giving
form to matter.</p>

<p>The science of crystallogeny,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> embracing the theoretical
and practical question of the causes producing these
geometric forms, has in various ways attempted to explain
the laws according to which molecules arrange
themselves on molecules in perfect order, giving rise to
a rigidly correct system of architecture. But it cannot
be said that any theory yet propounded is sufficiently
exact to embrace the whole of the known phenomena,
and the questions,&mdash;What is crystallogenic attraction,
and what is the physical nature of the ultimate particles
of matter,&mdash;are still open for the inquiries of that
genius which delights in wrestling with the secrets of
nature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span></p>
<p>The great Epicurus speculated on the “plastic nature”
of atoms, and attributed to this <i>nature</i> the power they
possess of arranging themselves into symmetric forms.
Modern philosophers satisfy themselves with attraction,
and, reasoning from analogy, imagine that each atom
has a polar system.</p>

<p>Electricity, and light, and heat, exert remarkable
powers, and accelerate or retard crystallisation according
to the conditions under which these forces are brought
to bear on the crystallising mass. We have recently
obtained evidence which appears to prove that some form
of magnetism has an active influence in determining the
natural forms of crystals, and we discover that magnetism
exerts a peculiar influence in relation to the optic axes of
crystals, which is not exerted in lines at right angles to
these. Electricity appears to quicken the process of
crystalline aggregation&mdash;to collect more readily together
those atoms which seek to combine&mdash;to bring them all
within the limits of that influence by which their symmetrical
forms are determined; and strong evidence is
now afforded, in support of the theory of magnetic
polarity, by the refined investigations of Faraday and
Plücker, which prove that magnetism has a <i>directing</i>
influence upon crystalline bodies.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>It has been found that crystals of sulphate of iron,
slowly forming from a solution which has been placed
within the range of sufficiently powerful magnetic force,
dispose themselves along certain magnetic curves, such
as are formed around a magnet by steel filings; whereas
the crystals of the Arbor Dianæ, or silver tree, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
under the same circumstances, take a position nearly at
right angles to these curves. Certain groups of crystals
have been found in nature, which appear to show, by
their positions, that terrestrial magnetism has been active
in producing the phenomena they exhibit; indeed,
nearly all our mineral formations indicate the influences
of this, or some similarly acting power.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>During rapid crystallisation, some salts&mdash;as the sulphate
of soda, boracic acid, and arsenious acid crystallising
in muriatic acid&mdash;exhibit decided indications of
electrical excitement; light is given out in flashes. We
have evidence that crystals exhibit a tendency to move
towards the light, and that crystallisation takes place
more readily, and progresses with greater activity in the
sunshine than in the shade. Professor Plücker has
recently ascertained that certain crystals&mdash;in particular
the cyanite&mdash;“point very well to the north, by the magnetic
power of the earth only. It is a true compass
needle; and, more than that, you may obtain its declination.”
We must remember that this crystal, the
cyanite, is a compound of silica and alumina only. This
is the amount of experimental evidence which science has
afforded in explanation of the conditions under which
nature pursues her wondrous work of crystal formation.
We see just sufficient of the operation to be convinced
that the luminous star which shines in the brightness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
Heaven, and the cavern-secreted gem, are equally the
result of forces which are known to us in only a few of
their modifications.</p>

<p>Every substance, when placed under circumstances
which allow of the free movement of its molecules, has
a tendency to crystallise. All the metals may, by slowly
cooling from the melting state, be exhibited with a crystalline
structure. Of the metallic and earthy minerals,
nature furnishes us with an almost infinite variety of
crystals, and, by a reduction of temperature, yet more
simple bodies assume the most symmetric forms. Water,
in the conditions of ice and snow, is a familiar and beautiful
example; and, by such extreme degrees of cold as
are artificially produced, many of the gases exhibit a
tendency to a crystalline condition.</p>

<p>May not the solid elementary atoms be susceptible of
change of form under different influences? May not
the different states under which the same bodies are
found&mdash;as, for example, silica, carbon, and iron&mdash;be due
entirely to a change in the form of the primitive atom?</p>

<p>Admitting the probability of this, we then easily see
that the central molecule, formed of an aggregation of
such atoms, uniting by particular faces, would present a
determinate form; and that the resulting crystal, a mass
of such molecules, cohering according to a given law, at
certain angles, would present such geometric figures as
we find in nature, or produce in our laboratories, when
we avail ourselves of processes which nature has taught
us.</p>

<p>If we take a particle of marble, and place it in a large
quantity of water acidulated with sulphuric acid, it
dissolves, and a new compound results. The marble
disappears&mdash;the eye cannot detect it by form or colour:
the acid also has been disguised&mdash;the taste discovers
nothing sour in the fluid. We have, in combination
with the water, the lime and sulphuric acid; but that
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: combinatiou">combination</span> appears to the eye in no respect different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
from the water itself. It is colourless and perfectly
transparent, although it holds a mass of solid matter
which previously would not allow of the permeation of
a ray of light. Let us expose this fluid to such circumstances
that the water will slowly evaporate, and we
shall find forming in it, after a time, microscopic particles
of solid, light-refracting matter. These particles
gradually increase in size, and we may watch their
growth until eventually we have a symmetric figure,
beautifully shaped, the primary form of which is a right
rhomboidal prism. Thus in nature, by the action, in
all probability, of vegetable matter on the sulphates held
in solution by the water of the great rivers and the
ocean&mdash;aided by our oxidizing atmosphere&mdash;sulphuric
acid is produced to do its work upon the limestone formations,
and from this combination would result the
well-known gypsum, or plaster of Paris, which ordinarily
exists as an amorphous mass, but is often found
in a crystalline form.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>This is a very perfect illustration of the wonderful
process we have been considering, and in which, simple
though it appears to be, we have set to work a large
proportion of the known physical elements of the
universe. By studying aright the result which we have
it in our power to obtain in a watch-glass, we may
advance our knowledge of gigantic phenomena, which
are now progressing at the bottom of the ocean, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
the wondrous agencies which are in operation, producing
light-refracting gems within the secret recesses of the
rocky crust of our globe.</p>

<p>The force of crystallisation is a subject worthy of
much consideration. If we examine our slate rocks,
through which little veins filled with quartz crystals
are spread, we shall see that the mechanical force
exerted during the production of these crystals has
been capable of rending those rocks in every direction.
Those fissures formed by the first <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sytsem">system</span> of crystalline
veins, in order of time, are filled in by another set
of crystalline bodies, which equally exert their mechanical
power, and thus produce those curious intersections
and dislocations which were long a puzzle to the geologist.
The simplest power, slowly and constantly
acting through a long period of time, may become
sufficient, eventually, to rend the Andes from base to
summit, or to lift a new continent above the waters of
the ocean.</p>

that their specific weight is connected with mass contained in the

Philosophical Conclusion.</p>


<p class="p2">We receive heat from the sun, associated with light; and
we have the power of developing this important principle
by physical, mechanical, and chemical excitation, from
every kind of matter. Our convictions are, that the
calorific element, whether derived from a solar or a
terrestrial source, presents no essential difference in its
physical characters; but as there are some remarkable
peculiarities in the phenomena, as they arise from
either one or the other source, it will assist our comprehension
of this great principle, if we consider it under
the two heads.</p>

<p>Untutored man finds health and gladness in the
warmth and light of the sun; he rears a rugged altar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
and bows his soul in prayer, to the principle of fire,
which in his ignorance he regards as the giver and the
supporter of life. The philosopher finds life and organization
dependent upon the powers combined in the
sunbeam; and, examining the phenomena of this
wonderful band of forces, he is compelled to acknowledge
that the flame upon the altar&mdash;on the Persian
hills,&mdash;was indeed a dim shadow of the infinite wisdom
which abides behind the veil.</p>

<p>The present condition of our earth is directly dependent
upon the amount of heat we receive from the sun.
It has frequently been said, that if it were possible to
move this planet so much nearer that orb that the
quantity of heat would be increased, the circumstances
of life would necessarily be so far changed, that all the
present races of animals must perish; and that the
same result would happen from any alteration which
threw us yet further from our central luminary, when,
owing to the extremity of cold and the wretchedness of
gloom, all living creatures would equally fail to support
their organization.</p>

<p>To move the earth nearer to, or more distant from
the sun, is an impossibility; but it has been argued
that those planets which are near to the sun must possess
a temperature which would melt our solid rocks,
and vaporize the ocean,&mdash;while Uranus and Neptune
must, from their distance from the source of heat, have
so small an amount, that water must become solid as
the rock, and such an atmosphere as that of the earth
exist as a dense liquid.</p>

<p>It will be shown that according to the physical condition
of the material substances, so are their powers regulated
of absorbing and retaining the heat which falls as a
radiant power upon their surfaces. Heat rays, in passing
through the attenuated medium of planetary space, lose
none of their power&mdash;this we know from the fact that even
the less dense upper region of the earth’s atmosphere
takes from the solar rays but an exceedingly small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
quantity of heat. Therefore, whether a solar heat ray
traverses through one million, or one hundred million
miles of space, it still retains its power equally of
imparting warmth to the solid matter by which it
is intercepted. There is no law of variation as the
inverse square of the distance of those radiating powers.
Consequently, there is no reason why the physical conditions,
alike of the nearest and the most remote
planetary bodies, should not be so adjusted that they all
enjoy that life promoting temperature which belongs to
the earth.</p>

<p>All the objects around us are adapted to the circumstances
of the earth’s position in relation to the sun, to
which we are bound by the principle of gravitation;
opposed to that centrifugal force which tends constantly
to drive the moving planetary mass off from the centre
of power. The balance maintains its perfect equilibrium,
although we have one power constantly drawing the
earth towards the sun, and the other as constantly
exerting itself to move it off into space at a tangent to
the orbit in which the planet moves. In our examination
it will be found that one common system of harmony
runs through all the cosmical phenomena, by which
everything is produced that is so beautiful and joyous in
this world.</p>

<p>Heat, and the other elementary radiant principles,
are often combined as the common cause of effects
evident to our senses. The warmth of the solar rays,
and their luminous influence, are not, however, commonly
associated in the mind as the results of a
single cause. It is only when we come to examine the
physical phenomena connected with these radiations
that we discover the complexity of the inquiry. Yet it
is out of these very subtle researches that we draw the
most refined truths. The high inferences to which the
analysis of the subtile agencies of creation leads us,
render science, pursued in the spirit of truth, a great
system of religious instruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Although we do not fear that heat and light can be
confounded in the mind, so different are their phenomena,&mdash;we
have heat rays, as from dark hot iron,
which give no light, while in the full flood of the lunar
rays the heat is scarcely appreciable by the most delicate
instruments;&mdash;yet it is important to show how far these
two principles have&mdash;been separated from each other.
Transparent bodies have varied powers of calorific transparency,
or transcalescence: some obstructing the heat
radiated from bodies of the highest temperatures almost
entirely even in the thinnest layers; whilst others will
allow the warmth of the hand to pass through a thickness
of several inches. Liquid chloride of sulphur, which is of
a deep red colour, will allow 63 out of 100 rays of heat
to pass, and a solution of carmine in ammonia, or glass
stained with oxides of gold, or copper, rather a greater
number; yet these transparent media obstruct a large
quantity of light. Colourless media obstructing scarcely
any light, will, on the contrary, prevent the passage of
calorific rays. Out of every hundred rays, oil of turpentine
will only transmit 31, sulphuric ether 21, sulphuric
acid 17, and distilled water only 11. Pure flint glass,
however, is permeated by 67 per cent. of the thermic rays,
and crown glass by 49 per cent. The body possessing
the most perfect transparency to the rays of heat is diaphanous
salt-rock, which transmits 92, while alum, equally
translucent, admits the passage of only 12 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span></p>
<p>Black mica, obsidian, and black glass, are nearly
opaque to light, but they allow 90 per cent. of radiant
heat to pass through them; whereas a pale green glass,
coloured by oxide of copper,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> covered with a layer of
water, or a very thin plate of alum, will, although
perfectly transparent to light, almost entirely obstruct
the permeation of heat rays.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span></p>
<p>We thus arrive at the fact that heat and light may be
separated from each other; and if we examine the solar
beam by that analysis which the prism affords, we shall
find that there is no correspondence between intense
light and ardent heat. By careful observation, it has
been proved, when we have a temperature of 62° F. in the
yellow ray, which ray has the greatest illuminating power;
that below the red ray, out of the point of visible light,
the temperature is found to be 79°, while at the other end
of the spectrum, in the blue ray, it is 56°, and at the end
of the violet ray no thermic action can be detected.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>From the circumstance, that as we, by artificial
means, raise the temperature of any body, and produce
intense heat, so after a certain point of thermic elevation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
has been obtained, we occasion a manifestation of <i>light</i>.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
It has been concluded, somewhat hastily, that heat and
light differ from each other only in the rapidity of the
undulations of an hypothetical ether.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the mathematical demonstrations
of many of the phenomena of calorific and
luminous power are <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sufficienlty">sufficiently</span> striking to convince us
that a wave-movement is common to both heat and
light. The undulatory theory, however, requires the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
admission of so many premises of which we have no
proof; its postulates are, indeed, in many cases so
gratuitous, that notwithstanding the array of talent
which stands forward in its support, we must not allow
ourselves to be deceived by the deductions of its advocates,
or dazzled by the brilliancy of their displays of
learning.</p>

<p>Radiant heat appears to move in waves; but that
calorific effects in material bodies are established by any
system of undulation, is a deduction without a proof;
and the thermic phenomena of matter are as easily explained
by the hypothesis of a diffusive subtile fluid.</p>

<p>We have not, however, to prove the correctness of
either of the opposing views; indeed, it is acknowledged
that many phenomena require for their explanation
conditions which are not indicated by either theory.</p>

<p>The earth receives its heat from the sun; a portion of
it is <i>conducted</i> from particle to particle into the interior
of the rocky crust. Another portion produces warmth
in the atmosphere around us, by <i>convection</i>, or the
circulation of particles; those warmed by contact with
the surface becoming lighter, and ascending to give
place to the colder and heavier ones. A third portion is
radiated off into space, according to laws which have
not been sufficiently investigated, but which are dependent
upon the colour, chemical composition, and mechanical
structure of the surface.</p>

<p>It cannot but be instructive to contemplate the
indications which we have of the dependence of all that
is beautiful on earth, on the heat and light radiations
which we receive from the sun. Let us endeavour to
realise some of the effects which arise from even the
temporary deprivation of solar heat.</p>

<p>It is winter, the vegetable world appears chilled to its
centre. The trees, except a few of the hardy evergreens,
are bare of leaves, and stretching forth their branches
into the cold air, they realise the condition of vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
skeletons. The lowly plants of the hedge-row, and the
grasses of the field, show that their vital power is subdued
to that minimum degree of action which is but a few
slight removes from death. The life of the running
stream is suspended, it is cased in the “thick-ribbed
ice,” and the waters beneath no longer send forth their
joyous music to the genial breeze. Even within the
temperate limits of our own land, the aspect of winter
convinces the ordinary observer, that the loss of heat
has been followed by diminished activity in the powers
of life; and the philosopher discovers that the lessened
energies of solar light, and the weaker action of the
radiant heat, have aided in producing that repose which
is a little more than sleep&mdash;a little less than death.</p>

<p>It is night, and winter: the earth is parting with its
heat,&mdash;with the absence of light, there is a still greater
loss of vigour, a yet further diminution of the powers of
life. Even the animal races, sustained by vital influences
of a more exalted kind, sink under the temporary
deprivation of the solar rays to a monotonous, a melancholy
repose. All animals undergo different degrees of
hybernation, and each in his winter retreat supports
vitality by preying upon himself. The world is hung in
mourning black; there is no play of colours to harmonize
the human spirit by sending their ethereal pulsations to
the human eye, and it is only the consciousness that
when the night is at the darkest, the day is nearest,
that even man’s soul is sustained against the depressing
influences of the absence of the sun.</p>

<p>The conditions which we must observe at our own
doors cannot fail to convey as a conviction to the least
imaginative mind, that a slightly prolonged continuance
of darkness, with its consequent increase of coldness,
would be fatal to the existence of the organic world.</p>

<p>The sun has entered Aries: it is spring. The length
of the day and night are equal, the powers of light and
darkness are now exactly balanced against each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
and light, like the Archangel, triumphs over the sombre
spirit. The organic world awakes. Chemical action
commences in the seed, the vital spark is kindled in the
embryo, and under the impulsive force of some solar
radiations the plant struggles into light and life. The
same invigorating force impels the circulation of the sap
through the capillary tubes of the forest tree, until the
topmost branch trembles with the new flow of life. The
buds burst forth into leaf, and a fresh and lively covering
spreads over those branches which, in their nakedness,
could scarcely be distinguished from the dead.</p>

<p>The animal races are no less sensible of the new
influence which is diffused around. The birds float
joyously upon the breeze, and give to heaven their
trilling songs of praise. The beasts come forth from
the clefts of the rocks and the tangled shelters of the
forests, and gambol in the full luxury of their renewed
vigour. Man, even man, the inhabitant of cities,
trained and tempered to an artificial state, awakes of a
spring morning with a fuller consciousness of mind, and
a deeper and more pleased sense of his intelligence,
than when the fogs and gloom of winter hung like the
charmed robe upon the limbs of the giant. Now, the
dormant poetry of man seeks expression. As the
morning sun is said to have awakened the musical undulations
of the Memnonian statue, so the sun of the
vernal morning produces in the mind of the most
earthly, faint pulsations of that heaven-born music, which
neither sin nor sorrow can entirely destroy. The psychologist,
in studying the peculiar phenomena of the
human mind, must associate himself with the natural
philosopher, and learn to appreciate the influence of
physical causes in determining effects which our elder
philosophers and the poets of every age have attributed to
spiritual agencies.</p>

<p>Summer, with its increased heat and light, reigns over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
the land. The work of life is now at its maximum, and
every energy is quickened throughout the organic
creation. The laws of nature are arranged on the
principle of antagonistic forces, the constant struggle to
maintain them in equilibrium constituting the sensible
phenomena of existence. Heat and light, with chemical
power and electricity, have been quickening the unknown
principle of life, until it has become exhausted
in the production of new parts&mdash;in the strange phenomenon
of growth&mdash;the formation of organized matter
from the inorganic stores of creation.</p>

<p>The autumn, with its tempered sunlight, comes, but in
the solar radiance we discover new powers, and under
the influence of these the flower and the fruit have
birth. The store of a new life is centered in the seed,
and though the leaf falls, and the flower fades, a new set
of organisms are produced, by which the continuance of
the species is secured.</p>

<p>Let any man examine himself as the seasons change,
and he will soon be convinced that every alternation of
light and darkness, of heat and its absence, produces new
sets of influences equally on the mind and on the body,
showing the entire dependence of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms upon those causes which appear to
flow from the centre of our planetary system.</p>

<p>The phenomena which connect themselves with the
changes of the seasons cannot fail to convince the most
superficial thinker that there is an intimate connection
between the sun and the earth which deserves our close
attention.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we examine the most ancient of histories,
we find one great fact at the base of all their philosophies.
Moses connects darkness with a void and formless
earth, and light with the creation of harmony and life.
Menis sings of a fearful world by “many formed darkness
encircled,” and links the idea of a “life-breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
divinity” with the awakening of light upon created
things. The Egyptian Isis, the Grecian Apollo, who,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Lord of boundless light</div>
<div class="verse">Ascending calm o’er the empyrean sails,</div>
<div class="verse">And with ten-thousand beams his awful beauty veils,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the fire-worshipper of the Persian hills and the sun-god
of the Peruvian mountains, exhibit, through time
and space, the full consciousness of man to the influences
of solar light and heat upon the organic creations of
which he is himself the chief exemplar.</p>

<p>The investigations of modern philosophers have extended
these influences to the inorganic masses which
constitute the Planet <span class="smcap">Earth</span>:&mdash;and we now know that
the physical forces, ever active in determining the
chemical condition and the electrical relations of matter,
are directly influenced by the solar radiations.</p>

<p>Few things within the range of our inquiry are more
striking than the phenomena of calorific radiation and
absorption. They display so perfectly the most refined
system of order, and exhibit so strikingly the admirable
adaptation of every formation to its particular conditions,
and for its part in the great economy of being,
that they claim most strongly the study of all who would
seek to discover a poetry in the inferences of science.</p>

<p>Owing to the nature of our atmosphere, we are protected
from the influence of the full flood of solar heat.
The absorption of caloric by the air has been calculated
at about one-fifth of the whole in passing through a
column of 6,000 feet. This estimate is, of course, made
near the earth’s surface; but we are enabled, knowing
the increasing rarity of the upper regions of our gaseous
envelope in which the absorption is constantly diminishing,
to prove, that about one-third of the solar heat is
lost by vertical transmission through the whole extent of
our atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span></p>
<p>Experience has proved that the conditions of the
sun’s rays are not always the same; and there are few
persons who have not observed that a more than usual
scorching influence prevails under some atmospheric
circumstances. This is also evidenced in the effects
produced on the foliage of trees, which, though often
attributed to electricity, is evidently due to heat. An
examination of the solar radiations, as exhibited in the
prismatic spectrum, has proved the existence of a class
of heat rays, which manifest themselves by a very peculiar
deoxidizing power quite independent of their caloric
properties, to which the name of <i>parathermic rays</i>
has been given.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> We are protected from the severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
effects of these rays by the ordinary state of the medium
through which the solar heat passes. Our atmosphere
is a mixture of gases and aqueous vapour; and it has
been found, as already stated, that even a thin film of
water, however transparent, prevents the passage of many
calorific radiations, and the rays retarded are, for the
most part, of that class which have this peculiar scorching
power. The air is, in this way, the great equaliser
of the solar heat, rendering the earth agreeable to all
animals, who, but for this peculiar absorbent medium,
would have to endure, even in our temperate clime, the
burning rays of a more than African sun.</p>

<p>The surface of the earth during the sunshine&mdash;and,
though in a less degree, even when the sun is obscured
by clouds&mdash;is constantly receiving heat; but the rate of
its absorption varies. Benjamin Franklin showed, by a
set of simple but most conclusive experiments, that a
piece of black cloth was warmed much sooner than cloth
of a lighter colour;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and we know, from observations
of a similar class, that the bare brown soil receives heat
more readily than the bright green grassy carpet of the
earth. Consequently, during the winter season, rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>tively
to the quantity poured from its source, more heat
penetrates the uncovered soil, than during the spring
or summer.</p>

<p>There is a constant tendency to an equilibrium; and,
during the night, the surface is robbed of more heat, by
the colder air, than by day; as, when the earth is not receiving
heat, it is constantly radiating it back into space.
Even in these processes of convection and radiation, a
similar law prevails to that which is discovered in examining
into the rate of calorific absorption.</p>

<p>Every tree spreading its green leaves to the sunshine,
or exposing its brown branches to the air&mdash;every flower
which lends its beauty to the earth&mdash;possesses different
absorbing and radiating powers. The chalice-like cup
of the pure white lily floating on the lake&mdash;the variegated
tulip&mdash;the brilliant anemony&mdash;the delicate rose&mdash;and the
intensely coloured peony or dahlia&mdash;have each powers
peculiar to themselves for drinking in the warming life-stream
of the sun, and for radiating it back again to the
thirsting atmosphere. These are no conceits of a scientific
dreamer; they are the truths of direct induction;
and, by experiments of a simple character, they may be
put to a searching test.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>A thermometric examination of the various coloured
flowers, by enclosing a delicate thermometer amongst
their leaves, will readily establish the correctness of the
one; and by a discovery of recent date, connected with
calorific radiation, which must be particularly described
presently, we can, with equal ease and certainty, test the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
truth of the other;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the absorption and radiation of
heat being directly regulated by the colours of the surfaces
upon which the sun rays fall.</p>

<p>It follows, as a natural consequence of the position of
the sun, as it regards any particular spot on the earth at
a given time, that the amount of heat is constantly varying
during the year. This variation regulates the
seasons.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the earth is, in the
winter, nearly three millions of miles nearer the sun
than in the summer, some explanation is required to
account for our suffering more cold when nearer the
source of heat, than when at the remotest distance.</p>

<p>The earth in her path around the sun describes an
ellipse, the sun’s place being one of its foci. In obedience
to the law, already described, of the conservation
of the axis of rotation, the axis of the earth constantly
points towards the star in the constellation of the
Little Bear. Recollecting this, and also the two facts,
that a dense solid body absorbs heat more readily than
a fluid one, and that radiation from the surface is constantly
going on when absorption is not taking place,
let us follow the earth in her orbit.</p>

<p>It is the time of the vernal equinox&mdash;we have equal
day and night&mdash;therefore the periods of absorption and
radiation of heat are alike. But at this time of the year
the southern hemisphere is opposite to the sun, consequently
the degree of absorption by the wide-spread
oceans small.</p>

<p>It is the summer solstice&mdash;we have sixteen hours of
daylight, when the absorption of heat is going on&mdash;and
but eight hours of night, during which heat is passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
off. The northern hemisphere is now presented to the
sun, and as here we have the largest portion of dry land,
the powers of absorption are at their maximum.</p>

<p>The autumnal equinox has arrived, with its equal day
and night, as in the spring, but now the whole northern
hemisphere is opposite the sun; hence, according to the
laws already explained, we see the causes of the increased
heat of the autumnal season.</p>

<p>The winter solstice has come, with its long night and
shortened day. The time during which radiation is
going on is nearly twice that in which absorption takes
place, and the earth is in her worst position for receiving
heat, as that half which has the largest surface of
water is towards the sun.</p>

<p>These are the causes which lead to the variations of
the seasons, and through these we learn why we are
colder when near the sun than when at a considerably
greater distance.</p>

<p>An analysis of the spectrum shows us that there are
some changes regularly taking place in the state of the
solar beam, which cannot be referred to the mere alteration
of position. It may be inferred, from facts
by long-continued observations, that the three classes
of phenomena&mdash;light, heat, and chemical power, distinguished
by the term Actinism&mdash;which we detect in the
sun’s rays, are constantly changing their relative proportions.
In spring, the chemical agency prevails; in
summer, the luminous principle is the most powerful;
and in the autumn, the calorific forces are in a state of
the greatest activity.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The importance of these variations,
to the great economy of vegetable life, will be
shown when we come to examine the phenomena connected
with organisation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span></p>
<p>A remarkable change takes place in the character of
heat in being reflected from material substances. In
nature we often see this fact curiously illustrated. Snow
which lies near the trunks of trees or wooden poles
melts much quicker than that which is at a distance
from them, the sun shining equally on both&mdash;the liquefaction
commencing on the side facing the sun, and
gradually extending. We see, therefore, that the direct
rays of solar heat produce less effect upon the snow than
those which are radiated from coloured surfaces. By
numerous experiments, it has been shown that these secondary
radiations are more abundantly absorbed by snow
or white bodies than the direct solar rays themselves.
Here is one of the many very curious evidences, which
science lays open to us, of the intimate connection between
the most ethereal and the grosser forms of matter.
Heat, by touching the earth, becomes more earth-like.
The subtile principle which, like the spirit of superstition,
has the power of passing, unfelt, through the
crystal mass, is robbed of its might by embracing the
things of earth; and although it still retains the evidences
of its refined origin, its movements are shackled as by a
clog of clay, and its wings are heavy with the dust of
this rolling ball. It has, however, acquired new properties,
which fit it for the requirements of creation, and
by which its great tasks are facilitated. Matter and
heat unite in a common bond, and, harmoniously pursuing
the necessities of some universal law, the result
is the extension of beautiful forms in every kingdom of
nature.</p>

<p>An easy experiment pleasingly illustrates this remarkable
change. If a blackened card is placed upon snow
or ice in the sunshine, the frozen mass underneath it will
be gradually thawed, and the card sink into it, while
that by which it is surrounded, although exposed to the
full power of solar heat, is but little disturbed. If, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>ever,
we reflect the sun’s rays from a metal surface, an
exactly contrary result takes place; the uncovered parts
are the first to melt, and the blackened card stands high
above the surrounding portion.</p>

<p>The evidences of science all indicate the sun as the
source, not only of that heat which we receive directly
through our atmosphere, but even of that which has
been stored by our planet, and which we can, by several
methods, develope. We have not to inquire if the earth
was ever an intensely heated sphere;&mdash;this concerns not
our question; as we should, even were this admitted,
still have to speculate on the origin&mdash;the primitive source
of this caloric.</p>

<p>Before, however, we proceed to the examination of
the phenomena of terrestrial heat, a few of the great
results of the laws of radiation and convection claim our
attention.</p>

<p>Nearly all the heat which the sun pours upon the
ocean is employed in converting its water into vapour at
the very surface, or is radiated back from it, to perform
the important office of producing those disturbing influences
in the atmosphere, which are essential to the preservation
of the healthful condition of the great aërial
envelope in which we live.</p>

<p>Currents of air are generally due to the unequal degrees
in which the atmosphere is warmed. Heat, by expanding,
increases the elasticity, and lessens the density, of a
given mass. Consequently, the air heated by the high
temperature of the tropics, ascends charged with aqueous
vapours, whilst the colder air of the temperate and the
frigid zones flows towards the equator to supply its place.
These great currents of the atmosphere are, independent
of the minor disturbances produced by local causes, in
constant flow, and by them a uniformity of temperature
is produced, which could not in any other way be accomplished.
By these currents, too, the equalisation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
constituents of the “breath of life” is effected, and the
purer oxygen of the “land of the sunny south” is diffused
in healthful gales over the colder climes of the
north. The waters, too, evaporated from the great
central Atlantic Ocean, or the far Pacific, are thus carried
over the wide-spread continents, and poured in fertilising
showers upon distant lands.</p>

<p>How magnificent are the operations of nature! The
air is not much warmed by the radiations of caloric passing
from the sun to the earth; but the surface soil is
heated by its power of absorbing these rays. The temperature
of the air next the earth is raised, and we thus
have the circulation of those beneficial currents which
are so remarkably regular in the Trade Winds. The air
heated within the tropics would ascend directly to the
poles, were the earth at rest, but being in motion, those
great aërial currents&mdash;the Trade Winds&mdash;are produced,
and the periodical monsoons are due to the same cause.
A similar circulation, quite independent of the ordinary
tidal movement, takes place also in the earth-girdling
ocean. The water, warmed, by convection, from the hot
surface of the tropical lands, sets across the Atlantic
from the Gulf of Mexico; and being under the influence
of the two forces&mdash;gravity and motion&mdash;it illustrates the
parallelogram of forces, and flowing along the diagonal,
reaches our own shores: the genial influences of
the gulf stream produce that tempered climate which
distinguishes our insular home. Here we have two immense
influences produced by one agency, rendering
those parts of the earth habitable and fertile, which but
for these great results would sorrow in the cheerless
aspect of an eternal winter.</p>

<p>The beautiful phenomenon of the formation of dew is
also distinctly connected with the peculiar properties
which we have been studying. When from the bright blue
vault of heaven, the sparkling constellations shower their
mild light over the earth, the flowers of the garden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
the leaves of the forest become moist with a fluid of
the most translucid nature. Well might the ancients
imagine that the dews were actually shed from the stars;
and the alchemists and physicians of the middle ages
conceive that this pure distillation of the night possessed
subtile and penetrating powers beyond most other
things; and the ladies of those olden times endeavour
to preserve their charms in the perfection of their youthful
beauty through the influences of washes procured
from so pure a source.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Science has removed the veil of mystery with which
superstition had invested the formation of dew; and, in
showing to us that it is a condensation of vapour upon
bodies according to a fixed law of radiation, it has also
developed so many remarkable facts connected with the
characters of material creations, that a much higher
order of poetry is opened to the mind than that which,
though beautiful, sprang merely from the imagination.</p>

<p>Upon the radiation of heat depends the formation of
dew, and bodies must become colder than the atmosphere
before it will be deposited upon them. At whatever
temperature the air may be, it is charged to
saturation with watery vapour, the quantity varying
uniformly with the temperature. Supposing the temperature
of the air to be 70° F., and that a bottle of
water at 60° is placed in it, the air around the bottle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
will be cooled, and will deposit on the glass exactly that
quantity of moisture which is due to the difference between
the temperature of the two bodies. Different
substances, independent of colour, have the property of
parting with heat from their surfaces at different rates.
Rough and porous surfaces radiate heat more rapidly
than smooth ones, and are consequently reduced in temperature;
and, if exposed, are covered with dew sooner
than such as are smooth and dense. The grass parterre
glistens with dew, whilst the hard and stony walk is unmoistened.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Colourless glass is very readily suffused with dampness,
but polished metals are not so, even when dews are
heavily condensed on other bodies. To comprehend
fully the phenomena of the formation of dew, we must
remember that the entire surface of the earth is constantly
radiating heat into space; and that, as by night no absorption
is taking place, it naturally cools.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> As the
substances spread over the earth become colder than the
air, they acquire the power of condensing the vapour
with which the atmosphere is always charged. The
bodies which cover this globe are very differently constituted;
they possess dissimilar radiating powers, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>sequently
present, when examined by delicate thermometers,
varying degrees of temperature. By the researches
of Dr. Wells,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> which may be adduced as an example of
the best class of inductive experiments, we learn that the
following differences in sensible heat were observed at
seven o’clock in the evening:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Differences in heat in the evening">
<tr><td>The air four feet above the grass</td><td class="tdpad">60&ndash;3/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wool on a raised board</td><td class="tdpad">54&ndash;1/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Swandown on ditto</td><td class="tdpad">53</td></tr>
<tr><td>The surface of the raised board</td><td class="tdpad">57</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grass plat</td><td class="tdpad">51</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Dew is most abundantly deposited on clear, calm
nights, during which the radiation from the surface of
the earth is uninterrupted. The increased cold of such
nights over those obscured by clouds is well known. The
clouds, it has been proved, act in the same way as the
screens used by gardeners to protect their young plants
from the frosts of the early spring, which obstruct the
radiation, and, in all probability, reflect a small quantity
of heat back to the earth.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the observed increase in
grass crops, when they have been strewn with branches
of trees or any slight shades, may be due to a similar
cause.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span></p>
<p>There are many remarkable results dependent entirely
on the colours of bodies, which are not explicable upon
the idea of difference in mechanical arrangement. We
know that different colours are regulated by the powers
which structures have of absorbing and reflecting light;
consequently a blue surface must have a different order
of molecular arrangement from a red one. But there
are some physical peculiarities which also influence heat
radiation, quite independently of this <i>surface</i> condition.
If we take pieces of red, black, green, and yellow glass,
and expose them when the dew is condensing, we shall
find that moisture will show itself first on the yellow,
then on the green glass, and last of all upon the black
or red glasses. The same thing takes place if we expose
coloured fluids in white glass bottles or troughs, in which
case the surfaces are all alike. If against a sheet of
glass, upon which moisture has been slightly frozen, we
place glasses similarly coloured to those already described,
it will be found that the earliest heat-rays will so warm
the red and the black glasses, that the ice will be melted
opposite to them, long before any change will be seen
upon the frozen film covered by the other colours.</p>

<p>The order in which heat permeates coloured media, it
has already been shown, very nearly agrees with their
powers of radiation.</p>

<p>These most curious results have engaged the attention
of Melloni, to whose investigations we owe so much;
and from the peculiar order of radiations, which present
phenomena of an analogous character to those of the
coloured rays of light, obtained by him from dissimilarly
coloured bodies, he has been led to imagine the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
of a “heat-colouration.” That is, the heat-rays are
supposed to possess properties like luminous colour
although invisible; and, consequently, that a blue surface
has a strong affinity for the blue heat-rays, a red
surface for the red ones, and so on through the scale.
The ingenuity of this hypothesis has procured it much
attention; but now, when the Newtonian hypothesis of
the refrangibility of light is nearly overturned, we must
not, upon mere analogy, rush to the conclusion that the
rays of heat have different orders of refrangibility, which
Melloni’s hypothesis requires.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Can anything be more calculated to impress the mind
with the consciousness of the high perfection of natural
phenomena, than the fact, that the colour of a body
should powerfully influence the transmission of a principle
which is diffused through all nature, and also determine
the rate with which it is to pass off from its surface.
Some recent experiments have brought us acquainted
with other facts connected with these heat-radiations,
and the power of heat, as influenced by the calorific
rays, to produce molecular changes in bodies, which bear
most importantly on our subject.</p>

<p>If we throw upon a plate of polished metal a prismatic
spectrum (deprived, as nearly as possible, of its chemical
power, by being passed through a deep yellow solution&mdash;which
possesses this property in a very remarkable
manner, as will be explained when we come to the examination
of the chemical action of the sun’s rays)&mdash;it
will be found, if we afterwards expose the plate to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
action of vapour, very slowly raised from mercury, that
the space occupied by the red rays, and those which lie
without the spectrum below it, will condense the vapour
thickly, while the portion corresponding with the other
rays will be left untouched. This affords us evidence of
the power of solar heat to produce, very readily, a change
in the molecular structure of solid bodies. If we allow
the sun’s rays to permeate coloured glasses, and then
fall upon a polished metallic surface, the result, on
exposing the plate to vapourisation, will be similar to
that just described. Under yellow and green glasses no
vapour will be condensed; but on the space on which
the rays permeating a red glass, or even a blackened one,
fall, a very copious deposit of vapour will mark with distinctness
the spaces these glasses covered. More remarkable
still, if these or any other coloured bodies are placed
in a box, and a polished metal plate is suspended a few
lines above them, the whole being kept <i>in perfect darkness</i>
for a few hours, precisely the same effect takes place
as when the arrangement is exposed to the full rays of
the sun. Here we have evidence of the radiating heat of
bodies, producing even in darkness the same phenomena
as the transmitted heat-rays of the sun. We must,
however, return to the examination of some of these and
other analogous influences under the head of actino-chemistry.</p>

<p>From these curious discoveries of inductive research
we learn some high truths. Associated with light&mdash;obeying
many of the same laws&mdash;moving in a similar
manner&mdash;we receive a power which is essential to the
constitution of our planet. This power is often manifested
in such intimate combination with the luminous
principle of the solar rays, that it has been suspected to
be but another form of the same agency. While, however,
we are enabled to show the phenomena of one
without producing those which distinguish the other,
we are constrained to regard heat as something dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>similar
to light. It is true that we appear to be tending
towards some point of proof on this problem; but we
are not in a position to declare them to be forms of one
common power, or “particular solutions of one great
physical equation.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In many instances it would certainly
appear that one of these forces was directly necessary
to the production of the other; but we have also
numerous examples in which they do not stand in any
such correlation.</p>

<p>We learn, from the scientific facts which we have been
discussing, a few of the secrets of natural magic. In
their relations to heat, every flower, which adds to the
adornment of the wilds of nature or the carefully-tended
garden of the florist, possesses a power peculiar to itself;</p>

sunshine.</p>

<p>Every plant bears within itself the measure of the
heat which is necessary for its well-being, and is endued
with functions which mutely determine the relative
amount of dew which shall wet its coloured leaves.
Some of the terrestrial phenomena of this remarkable
principle will still further illustrate the title of this
volume.</p>

<p>To commence with the most familiar illustrations, let
us consider the consequences of change of temperature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
However slight the additional heat may be to which a
body is subjected, it expands under its influence; consequently,
every atom which goes to form the mass of
the earth moves under the excitation, and the first heat
ray of the morning which touches the earth’s surface,
sets up a vibration which is continued as a tremor to its
very centre. The differences between the temperature
of day and night are considerable; therefore all bodies
expand under the influence of the higher, and contract
under that of the lower temperature. During the day,
any cloud obscuring the sun produces, in every solid,
fluid, or aëriform body, within the range of solar influence,
a check: the particles which had been expanding
under the force of heat suddenly contract. Thus
there must of necessity be, during the hours of sunshine,
a tendency in all bodies to dilate, and during the hours
of night they must be resuming their original conditions.</p>

<p>Not only do dissimilar bodies radiate heat in different
degrees, but they conduct it also with constantly varying
rates. Heat passes along silver or copper with readiness,
compared to its progress through platinum. It is
conducted by glass but slowly, and still more slowly by
wood and charcoal. We receive some important intimations
of the molecular structure of matter, from those
experiments which prove that heat is conducted more
readily along some lines than others. In some planes,
wood and other substances are better conductors than in
others. The metallic oxides or earths are bad conductors
of heat, by which provision the caloric absorbed by
the sun’s rays is not carried away from the surface of this
planet so rapidly as it would have been had it been of
metal, but is retained in the superficial crust to produce
the due temperature for healthful germination and
vegetable growth. The wool and hair of animals are still
inferior conductors, and thus, under changes of climate
and of seasons, the beasts of the field are secured against
those violent transitions from heat to cold which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
be fatal to them. Hair is a better conductor than wool:
hence, by nature’s alchemy, hair changed into wool in
the animals of some countries on the approach of winter,
and feathers into down.</p>

<p>It is therefore evident that the rate at which solar
heat is conducted into the crust of the earth must alter
with the condition of the surface upon which it falls.
The conducting power of all the rocks which have been
examined is found to vary in some degree.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>It follows, as a natural consequence of the position of
the sun to the earth, that the parts near the equator
become more heated than those remote from it. As this
heat is conducted into the interior of the mass, it has a
tendency to move to the colder portions of it, and thus
the heat absorbed at the equator flows towards the poles,
and from these parts is carried off by the atmosphere, or
radiated into space. Owing to this, there is a certain
depth beneath the surface of our globe at which an equal
temperature prevails, the depth increasing as we travel
north or south from the equator, and conforming to the
contour of the earth’s surface, the line sinking under
the valleys and rising under the hills.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p>A question of great interest, in a scientific point of
view, is the temperature of the centre of the earth. We
are, of course, without the means of solving this problem;
but we advance a little way onwards in the inquiry
by a careful examination of subterranean temperature at
such depths as the enterprise of man enables us to reach.
These researches show us, that where the mean temperature
of the climate is 50°, the temperature of the rock at
59 fathoms from the surface is 60°; at 132 fathoms it is
70°; at 239 fathoms it is 80°: being an increase of 10°
at 59 fathoms deep, or 1° in 35·4 feet; of 10° more at
73 fathoms deeper, or 1° in 43·8 feet; and of 10° more
at 114 fathoms still deeper, or 1° in 64·2 feet.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Although this would indicate an increase to a certain
depth of about one degree in every fifty feet, yet it would
appear that the rate of increase diminishes with the
depth. It appears therefore probable, that the heat of
the earth, so far as man can examine it, is due to the
absorption of the solar rays by the surface. The
evidences of intense igneous action at a great depth
cannot be denied, but the doctrine of a cooling mass, and
of the existence of an incandescent mass, at the earth’s
centre, remains but one of those guesses which active
minds delight in. The mean annual temperature of this
planet is subject to variations, which are probably
dependent upon some physical changes in the sun himself,
or in the atmospheric envelope by which that orb is
surrounded. The variations over the earth’s surface are
great. At the equator we may regard the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
as uniformly existing at 80°, while at the poles it is
below the freezing point of water; and as far as observations
have been made, the subterranean temperatures
bear a close relation to the thermic condition of the
climate of the surface. The circulation of water through
faults or fissures in the strata is, without doubt, one
means of carrying heat downwards much quicker than
it would be conducted by the rocks themselves. It is
not, however, found that the quantity of water increases
with the depth. In the mines of Cornwall, unless where
the ground is very loose, miners find that, after about
150 fathoms (900 feet), the quantity of water rapidly
diminishes. That water must ascend from very much
greater depths is certain, from the high temperatures at
which many springs flow out at the surface. In the
United Mines in Cornwall, water rises from one part of
the lode at 90°; and one of the levels in these workings
is so hot that, notwithstanding a stream of cold water is
purposely brought into it to reduce the temperature, the
miners work nearly naked, and will bathe in water at
80° to cool themselves. At the bottom of Tresavean
Mine, in the same county, about 320 fathoms from the
surface, the temperature is 100°.</p>

<p>One cause of the great heat of many of our deep
mines, which appears to have been entirely lost sight of,
is the chemical action going on upon large masses of
pyritic matter in their vicinity. The heat, which is so
oppressive in the United Mines, is, without doubt, due
to the decomposition of immense quantities of the sulphurets
of iron and copper known to be in this condition
at a short distance from these mineral works.</p>

<p>The heat which man is enabled to measure beneath the
earth’s surface, appears to be alone due to the conducting
powers of the rocks themselves; it has been observed
that the line of equal temperature follows, as nearly as
possible, the elevations and depressions which prevail
upon the surface, and the diminishing rate of increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
beyond this line, certainly is such as would arise, was all
the heat so measured, the result of the passage of the
heat by conduction through the crust of rocks.</p>

<p>Whether or not the subterranean bands of equal heat
have any strict relation, upon a large scale, to the
isothermic lines which have been traced around most
portions of our globe, is a point which has not yet been
so satisfactorily determined as to admit of any general
deductions.</p>

<p>The Oriental story-teller makes the inner world a
place of rare beauty&mdash;a cavern temple, bestudded with
self-luminous gems, in which reside the spiritual beings
to whom the direction of the inorganic world is confided.</p>

<p>The Philosopher, in the height of his knowledge, has
had dreams as absurd as this; and amid the romances of
science, there are not to be found any more strange visions
than those which relate to the centre of our globe. At
the same time it must be admitted, that many of the
peculiar phenomena which modern geological researches
have brought to light, are best explained on the hypothesis
of a cooling sphere, which necessarily involves the
existence of a very high temperature towards the
centre.</p>

<p>We have already noticed some remarkable differences
between solar and terrestrial heat; but a class of observations
by Delaroche<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> still requires our attention. Solar
heat passes freely through colourless glass, whereas the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
radiations from a bright fire or a mass of incandescent
metal are entirely obstructed by this medium. If we
place a lamp or a ball of glowing hot metal before a
metallic reflector, the focus of accumulated heat is soon
discovered; but if a glass mirror be used, the light is
reflected, but not the heat; whereas, with the solar rays,
but little difference is detected, whether vitreous or
metallic reflectors are employed. It is well known that
glass lenses refract both the light and heat of the sun,
and they are commonly known as burning-glasses: the
heat accumulated at their focal point being of the highest
intensity. If, instead of the solar beam, we employ, in
our experiments, an intense heat produced by artificial
means, the passage of it is obstructed, and the most
delicate thermometers remain undisturbed in the focus of
the lens. Glass exposed in front of a fire becomes
warm, and by conduction the heat passes through it,
and a secondary radiation takes place from the opposite
side.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It has been found that glass is transcalescent, or
<i>diathermic</i>, to some rays of terrestrial heat, and <i>adia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>themic</i>,
or opaque for heat, to others<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>&mdash;that the capability
of permeating glass increases with the temperature of
the ignited body&mdash;and that rays which have passed one
screen traverse a second more readily. It would,
however, appear that something more than a mere
elevation of temperature is necessary to give terrestrial
heat-radiations the power of passing through glass
screens, or, in other words, to acquire the properties of
solar heat.</p>

<p>To give an example. The heat of the oxy-hydrogen
flame is most intense, yet glass obstructs it, although it
may be assisted by a parabolic reflector. If this flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
is made to play upon a ball of lime, by which a most
intense light is produced, the heat, which has not been
actually increased, acquires the power of being refracted
by a glass lens, and combustible bodies may be ignited
in its focus.</p>

<p>It certainly appears from these results, that the
undulatory hypothesis holds true, so far as the motion of
the calorific power is concerned. At a certain rate the
vibrations are thrown back or stopped by the opposing
body, while in a state of higher excitation, moving with
increased rapidity, they permeate the screen.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> This
does not, indeed, interfere with the refined theory of
Prévost,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> which supposes a mutual and equal interchange
of caloric between all bodies.</p>

<p>The most general effect of heat is the expansion of
matter; solids, liquids, and airs, all expand under its
influence. If a bar of metal is exposed to calorific
action, it increases in size, owing to its particles being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
separated farther from each other: by continuing this
influence, after a certain time the cohesion of the mass is
so reduced that it melts, or becomes liquid, and, under
the force of a still higher temperature, this molten metal
may be dissipated in vapour. It would appear as if,
under the agency of the heat applied to a body, its atoms
expanded, until at last, owing to the tenuity of the outer
layer or envelope of each atom, they were enabled to
move freely over each other, or to interpenetrate without
difficulty. That heat does really occasion a considerable
disturbance in the corpuscular arrangement of bodies,
may be proved by a very interesting experiment. A
bar of heated metal is placed to cool, with one end supported
upon a wedge or a ring of a different metal the
other resting on the ground. In cooling, a distinct
musical sound is given out, owing to the vibratory action
set up among the particles of matter moving as the temperature
declines.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span></p>
<p>Heat is diffused through all bodies in nature, and, as
we shall presently see, may be developed in many different
ways. We may, therefore, infer, that in converting a
sphere of ice into water, and that again into steam, we
have done nothing more than interpenetrate the mass
with a larger quantity of heat, by which its atoms are
more widely separated, and that thus its molecules
become free to move about each other. Hence, from a
solid state, the water becomes fluid; and then, if the expansive
force is continued, an invisible vapour. If these
limits are passed by the powers of any greatly increased
thermic action, the natural consequence, it must be
seen, will be the separation of the atoms from each
other, to such an extent that the molecule is destroyed,
and chemical decomposition takes place.</p>

<p>By the agency of the electricity of the voltaic battery,
we are enabled to produce the most intense heat with
which we are acquainted, and by a peculiarly ingenious
arrangement Mr. Grove has succeeded in resolving
water by the mere action of heat into its constituent
elements&mdash;oxygen and hydrogen gases. That this decomposition
is not due to the voltaic current, but to the heat
produced by it, was subsequently proved by employing
platina heated by the oxy-hydrogen flame.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>This interesting question has been examined with
great care by Dr. Robinson of Armagh, who has shown
that, as the temperature of water is increased, the affinity
of its elements is lessened, until at a certain point it
is eventually destroyed. This new and startling fact
appears scarcely consistent with our knowledge that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
body heated so as to be luminous has the power of
causing the combination of the elements of water with
explosive violence.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But as this acute experimental
philosopher somewhat boldly but still most reasonably
inquires: “Is it not probable that, if not light, some
other actinic power (like that which accompanies light in
the spectrum, and is revealed to us by its chemical
effects in the processes of photography) is evolved by the
heat, and, though invisible, determines, in conjunction
with the affinity, that atomic change which transforms
the three volumes of oxygen and hydrogen into two of
steam?”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>This speculation explains, in a very satisfactory manner,
some results which were obtained by Count Rumford, in
1798. In a series of experiments instituted for the
purpose of examining “those chemical properties of
light which have been attributed to it,” he has shown
that many cases of chemical decomposition occur in
perfect darkness, under the influence of heat, which are
precisely similar to those produced by exposure to the
sun’s rays.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>It must, however, be remembered, that both solar
light and heat are sometimes found in direct antagonism
to actinic power, and that the most decided chemical
changes are produced by those rays in which neither
heat nor light can be detected. The most remarkable
phenomena of this class will be explained under the
head of actinism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>One of the most curious relations which as yet
have been discovered between light and heat is, that, the
temperature at which all bodies become incandescent,
excepting such as are phosphorescent, is uniform. The
point on the thermometer (Fahrenheit’s scale) when
the eye by perfect repose is enabled to detect the first
luminous influence, may probably be regarded as, or
very near, 1000°. Daniel has fixed this point at 980°,
Wedgwood at 947°, and Draper at 977°.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Dr. Robinson
and Dr. Draper, by independent observations, have
both arrived at the conclusion, that the first gleam of
light which appears from heated platina is not red, but of
a lavender gray, the same in character of colour as that
detected by Sir John Herschel among the most refrangible
rays of the solar spectrum.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It must be admitted, that the question of the identity,
or otherwise, of light and radiant heat, is beset with
difficulties. Many of their phenomena are very similar&mdash;many
of their modes of action are alike: they are
often found as allied agencies; but they as frequently
exhibit extreme diversity of action, and they may be
separated from each other.</p>

<p>We have now examined the physical conditions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
properties of this most important element, and we must
proceed to learn something of the means by which it
may be developed, independently of its solar source.</p>

<p>This extraordinary principle exists in a latent state in
all bodies, and may be pressed out of them. The blacksmith
hammers a nail until it becomes red hot, and from
it he lights the match with which he kindles the fire of
his forge. The iron has by this process become more
dense, and percussion will not again produce incandescence
until the bar has been exposed in fire to a red
heat. The only inference we can draw from this result
is, that by hammering the particles have been driven
closer together, and the heat driven out; now further
hammering will not force the atoms nearer, and consequently
no additional quantity of heat can be developed;
the iron is made hot in a fire, it absorbs heat, the
particles are restored to their former state, and we can
now again by hammering develope both heat and light.
The Indian produces a spark by the attrition of two
pieces of wood. By friction, two pieces of ice may be
made to melt each other; and could we, by mechanical
pressure, force water into a solid state, an immense
quantity of heat would be set free. By the condensation
of hydrogen and oxygen gases, pulverulent platinum
will become glowing red-hot, and, with certain precautions,
even the compact metal, platinum, itself;
the heat being derived from the gases, the union of
which it has effected. A body passing from the solid to
the fluid state absorbs heat from all surrounding substances,
and hence a degree of cold is produced. The
heat which is thus removed is not destroyed&mdash;it is held
combined with the fluid; it exists in a latent state.
Fluids, in passing into a gaseous form, also rob all surrounding
bodies of an amount of heat necessary to
maintain the aëriform condition. From the air or from
the fluid, this heat may, as we have shown above, be
again extracted. Locked in a pint measure of air, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
exists sufficient heat to raise several square inches of
metal to glowing redness. By the compression of
atmospheric air this may be shown, and with a small
condensing syringe a sufficient quantity of heat may be
set free to fire the <i>Boletus igniarius</i>, which, impregnated
with nitre, is known as <i>amadou</i>. We are acquainted
with various sources from which heat may be developed
for artificial purposes: the flint-and-steel is an example
of the production of heat by mechanical force, and the
modern lucifer-match, of the combined action of friction
and chemical affinity. These of themselves would admit
of a lengthened discourse; but it is necessary that we
carefully examine some of the less familiar phenomena of
heat under the influences of changes of chemical condition.</p>

<p>If spirits of wine and water are mixed together, a
considerable degree of heat is given out, and by mixing
sulphuric acid and water, an infinitely larger quantity.
If sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) and spirit of wine, or
nitric acid (aquafortis) and spirits of turpentine, at common
temperatures, be suddenly mixed, so much heat is
set free as to ignite the spirit. In each of these instances
there is a condensation of the fluid. In nearly
all cases of solution, cold is produced by the absorption
of the heat necessary to sustain the salt in a liquid
form; but when potash dissolves in water, heat is given
out, which is a fact we cannot yet explain. If potassium
is placed on water, it seizes the oxygen of the water
and sets fire to the hydrogen gas liberated by the heat
produced in the change of form. Antimony and many
other metals thrown into chlorine gas ignite and burn
with brilliancy: the same phenomenon takes place in
the vapours of iodine or bromine. Many chemical combinations,
as the chloride of potassium and sulphur explode
with a blow; whilst the slightest friction occasions
the detonation of the fulminating salts of silver, mercury,
and gold. Compounds of nitrogen and chlorine, or
iodine, are still more delicately combined&mdash;the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
exploding with fearful violence on the contact of any
oleaginous body, and the latter by the smallest elevation
of temperature: both of them destroying the vessels in
which they may be contained.</p>

<p>Gun cotton presents some peculiar phenomena
which may merit brief attention. This peculiar compound
is prepared by the action of nitric acid on
cotton fibre. The general appearance of the cotton
is not altered, but a remarkable physical change
has taken place. It is now soluble in ether, and
forms a gelatinous compound:&mdash;it explodes violently
at a temperature which is insufficient for the combustion
of gunpowder. Indeed, from, as it would appear, slight
electrical disturbances taking place in the gun cotton
itself, it not unfrequently explodes spontaneously. These
fearful disturbances of the forces which hold bodies in
combination are explained with difficulty. May it not
be, that an enormous quantity of the calorific and
chemical principles is held in a state of extreme tension
around the particles of the compound, and that the
equilibrium being destroyed, the whole is developed in
destructive rapidity?</p>

<p>The fact of great heat being evolved during the conversion
of a body from a solid to a gaseous state, as in
the explosion of gunpowder or gun cotton, which is a
striking exception to the law of latent heat, as it prevails
in most cases, admits of no more satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>As mechanical force produces calorific excitation, so
we find that every movement of sap in vegetables, and
of the blood and fluids in the animal economy, causes a
sensible increase of heat. The chemical processes constantly
going on in plants and animals are another
source of heat, in addition to which nervous energy and
muscular movement must be regarded as producing the
caloric which is essential to the health and life of the latter.
Digestion has been considered as a process of combustion;
and the action between the elements of food, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
the oxygen conveyed by the circulation of the blood to
every part of the body, regarded as the source of animal
heat; and, without doubt, it is one great source,
although it can scarcely be regarded as the only one.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span></p>
<p>The <i>vis vitæ</i>, or vital power, influences the delicate
and beautiful system of nerves; and as life (an essence
of the rarest and most subtile order, a diffusive influence)
runs through them, from the brain to the extremities of
the members of the body, it sets those tender threads in
rapid vibration, and heat is developed. By this action,
the circulation of the blood is effected; the muscle is
maintained in an elastic condition, ready to perform the
tasks of the will; and through these agencies is the
warm and fluid blood fitted to receive its chemical
restoratives in the lungs, and the stomach to support
changes for which it is designed&mdash;chemical also&mdash;by
which more heat is liberated. Was digestion&mdash;<i>Eremacausis</i>,
as the slow combustion produced by combination
with oxygen is called&mdash;the only source of animal heat,
why should the injury of one filmy nerve place a member
of the body for ever in the condition of stony coldness?
Or why, chemical action being most actively continued
after a violent death, by the action of the gastric juices
upon the animal tissues, should not animal heat be
maintained for a much longer period than it is found to
be after respiration has ceased?<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In studying the influences of caloric upon the conditions
of matter, we must regard the effects of extreme
heat, and also of the greatest degrees of cold which have
been obtained.</p>

<p>There are a set of experiments by the Baron Cagniard
de la Tour, which appear to have a very important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
bearing on some conditions that may be supposed to
prevail in nature, particularly if we adopt the view
of a constantly increasing temperature towards the
centre of our earth. If water, alcohol, or ether, is
put into a strong glass tube of small bore, the ends
hermetically sealed, and the whole exposed to a strong
heat, the fluid disappears, being converted into a transparent
gas; but, upon cooling, it is again condensed,
without loss, into its original fluid state.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In this experiment,
fluid bodies have been converted into elastic
transparent gases with but small change of volume,
under the pressure of their own atmospheres. We can
readily conceive a similar result occurring upon a far
more extensive scale. In volcanic districts, at great
depths, and consequently under the pressure of the
superincumbent mass, the siliceous rocks, or even metals,
may, from the action of intense heat, be brought into a
fluid, or even a gaseous condition, without any change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
volume, since the elastic force of heat is opposed by the
rigid resistance of the pressure of the surrounding
rocks. Some beautiful experiments by Mr. Hopkins, of
Cambridge, have proved that the temperature necessary
to melt a body must be considerably elevated as
the mechanical pressure to which it is subjected is
increased.</p>

<p>Directly connected with the results of Cagniard de la
Tour are a yet more remarkable set of phenomena,
which have been investigated by M. Boutigny,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and
generally known as the “spheroidal condition” of bodies.
If water is projected upon very hot metal it instantly
assumes a spheroidal form&mdash;an internal motion of its
particles may be observed&mdash;it revolves with rapidity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
and evaporates very slowly. If a silver or platinum
capsule, when brought to a bright red heat, is filled with
cold water, the whole mass assumes the spheroidal
state, the temperature of the fluid remaining considerably
below the boiling point, so long as the red heat is
maintained. If we allow the vessel to cool below redness
in the dark, the water then bursts into active
ebullition, and is dissipated into vapour with almost explosive
violence. An equal quantity of water being
projected into two similar vessels, over the fire, one cold
and the other red hot, it will be found that the water in
the cold vessel will boil and evaporate long before that
in the one which is red hot.</p>

<p>Another form of this experiment is exceedingly instructive.
If a mass of white hot metal is suddenly
plunged into a vessel of cold water, the incandescence is
not quenched, the metal shines with a bright white
light, and the water is seen to circulate around, but at
some distance from the glowing mass, being actually
repelled by calorific agency. At length, when the
metal cools, the water comes in contact with it, and
boils with energy.</p>

<p>A result similar to this was observed by Perkins, but
its correctness most unjustly doubted. Having made an
iron shell containing water, and carefully plugged up,
white hot, it was found that the steam never exerted
sufficient force to burst the vessel, as it was expected it
would do. He caused a hole to be drilled into the
bottom of the white-hot shell, and he was surprised to
find that no water flowed through the orifice, until the
iron was considerably cooled, when it issued forth with
violence in the form of steam. Here we have the
<i>Cagniard de la Tour state</i> first induced, and the calorific
repulsion of the spheroidal state supervenes. If water is
poured upon an iron sieve, the wires of which are made
red hot, it will not percolate; but on cooling, it runs
through rapidly. M. Boutigny, pursuing this curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
inquiry, has recently proved that the moisture upon the
skin is sufficient to protect it from disorganization, if
the arm is plunged into baths of melted metal. The
resistance of the surfaces is so great, that little elevation
of temperature is experienced.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Professor <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Plucker">Plücker</span>, of
Bonn, has stated that by washing the arm with ether
previously to plunging it into melted metal, the sensation
produced, while in the molten mass, is that of freezing
coldness.</p>

<p>We have now seen that heat at different degrees of
intensity appears to produce chemical composition&mdash;that
it decomposes combined elements&mdash;that it alters
the conditions of bodies, and actually maintains so
powerfully a repellent force, that fluids cannot touch
the heated body. More than this, it exerts a most
powerful antagonistic influence over all chemical relations.
If, to give one example, the volatile element
iodine is put into a glowing hot capsule, it resolves itself
immediately into a spheroid. Potash rapidly combines
with iodine; but if a piece of this alkali is thrown upon
it in the capsule, it also takes the spheroidal form, and
both bodies revolve independently of each other, their
chemical affinities being entirely suspended;&mdash;but allow
the capsule to cool, and they combine immediately.
Science teaches us that a temperature so exalted as not
to burn organic bodies may be produced, and points to
us this remarkable fact, that the destructive limits of
heat are measured between certain degrees&mdash;beyond
which a fire, by reason of its intensity, ceases to
develope heat. What is the radiant force into which this
principle changes?</p>

<p>The experiments of Cagniard de la Tour and of
Boutigny (d’Evreux), connect themselves, in a striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
manner, with those of Mr. Grove and Dr. Robinson;
and they teach us that but a very slight alteration in the
proportions of the calorific principle given to this planet
would completely change the character of every material
substance of which it is composed, unless there was an
alteration in the physical condition of the elements
themselves.</p>

<p>Supposing the ordeal of fiery purification to take
place upon this earth, these experiments appear to indicate
the mighty changes which would thence result.
There would be no annihilation, but everything would
be transformed from the centre of the globe to the verge
of its atmosphere&mdash;old things would pass away, all
things become new, and the beautiful mythos of the
phœnix be realized in the fresh creation.</p>

<p>The deductions to be drawn from the results obtained
by abstracting heat from bodies are equally instructive.
By taking advantage of the cooling produced by the
rapid solution of salts of several kinds in water, an
intense degree of coldness may be produced.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Indeed,
the absorption of heat by liquefaction may be shown by
the use of metallic bodies alone. If lead, tin, and
bismuth, are melted together, and reduced to a coarse
powder by being poured into water, and the alloy then
dissolved in a large quantity of quicksilver, the thermometer
will sink nearly 50 degrees. An intense amount
of cold will result from the mixture of muriate of lime
and snow, by which a temperature of 50° below the zero
of Fahrenheit, or 82° below the freezing point of water,
is produced. By such a freezing mixture as this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
mercury will be rendered solid. A degree of cold, however,
far exceeding it, has lately been obtained by the
use of solid carbonic acid and ether.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Solid carbonic
acid is itself procured from the gas liquefied by pressure;
which liquid, when allowed to escape into the air,
evaporates so rapidly that a large quantity of it is congealed
by being robbed of its combined heat by the
vaporizing portion. When this solid acid is united with
ether, a bath is formed in which the carbonic acid will
remain solid for twenty or thirty minutes. By a mixture
of this kind, placed under the receiver of an air-pump,
a good exhaustion being sustained, a degree of
cold 166° below zero is secured. By this intense cold,
many of the bodies which have hitherto been known to
us only in the gaseous state have been condensed into
liquids and solids. Olefiant gas, a compound of hydrogen
and carbon, was brought into a liquid form. Hydriodic
and hydrobromic acids could be condensed into
either a liquid or a solid form. Phosphuretted hydrogen,
a gas which inflames spontaneously when brought
into contact with the air or with oxygen, became a
transparent liquid at this great reduction of temperature.
Sulphurous acid may be condensed, by pressure and a
reduction of temperature, into a liquid which boils at 14°
Fahrenheit, but by the carbonic acid bath it is converted
into a solid body, transparent and without colour. Sulphuretted
hydrogen gas solidifies at 122° below zero, and
forms a white substance resembling a mass of crystals
of sea-salt.</p>

<p>A combination of the two gases, chlorine and oxygen,
becomes solid at -75°, and the protoxide of nitrogen at -150°.
Cyanogen, a compound of carbon and nitrogen&mdash;the
base of prussic acid&mdash;is solidified at 30° below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
the zero of our thermometric scale. The well-known
pungent compound, ammonia, so exceedingly volatile at
common temperatures, is converted into a crystalline,
translucent, white substance at the temperature of
-103°. The difficulties which necessarily attend the
exposure of a body to extreme cold and great pressure
at the same time, appear to be the only obstacle to the
condensation of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen gases.
A sufficient amount of condensation was, however,
effected by Dr. Faraday, to lead him to the conclusion,
arrived at also by other evidences, that hydrogen, the
lightest of the ponderable bodies, partakes of the nature
of a metal.[82]</p>

<p>During the solidification of water by freezing, some
remarkable facts may be noticed.</p>

<p>Water, in cooling, gradually condenses in volume
until it arrives at 40° Fahr., which appears to be the
point of greatest density. From this temperature to
that of 32°, the point at which it begins to solidify, its
volume remains unchanged,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> as crystallisation (freezing)
begins, the bulk increases, the mass becomes specifically
lighter, and it swims on the surface of the fluid. From
40° to 32° the particles of water must be taking up
that new position which is essential to the formation of
the solid&mdash;ice; and while this is taking place, every
substance held in solution by the water is rejected.</p>

<p>If we mix with water the deepest colouring matter&mdash;the
strongest acid or the most acrid poison&mdash;they are
each and all rejected during the process of freezing, and
if the water has been kept in a state of agitation during
the process&mdash;so that the liberated particles may not be
mechanically entangled&mdash;the ice will be transparent,
colourless, tasteless, and inert&mdash;the substances rejected
being gathered together in the centre of the frozen mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
in a state of intense concentration. In like manner,
even the atmospheric air, which is always held in solution,
is rejected, and hence the reason why all the ice
which forms upon still ponds is full of air-bubbles, while
the ice which is produced in agitated water is perfectly
free from them. This in itself is a remarkable condition,
the entire bearing of which is not clearly understood;
but a still more singular fact has been discovered in
intimate connection with the rejection of all matter from
a freezing solution. Water, which in this way is freed
entirely of air, will not boil at 212° F., the ordinary
boiling point of water.</p>

<p>If a mass of ice formed in the manner described is
placed in a vessel, and being just covered with a film of
oil, to prevent the absorption of air, is melted over a
lamp or fire, and the heat continued, it will, so far from
being converted into steam at 212°, continue to increase
in temperature up to 270° or more, and then burst into
ebullition with such explosive violence as to rend the
vessel in which it is confined.</p>

<p>From this experiment we learn that did water exist
in any other condition than that in which we find it&mdash;even
with the apparently simple difference of containing
no air&mdash;it would not be safe to employ it in any culinary
or manufacturing operation, since its use would be followed
by explosions as dangerous as those of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Such researches as these prove to us the admirable
adaptation of all things to their especial ends&mdash;the beautiful
adjustment of the balance of forces throughout
creation.</p>

<p>The refinements of Grecian philosophy saw, without
the aids of inductive science, that the outward vesture of
nature covered a host of mysterious agencies to which
its characteristics were directly due. In their dream of
the four elements, fire, the external and visible form of
heat, was regarded as the cause of vitality, and the
disposer of every organised and unorganised condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
of matter. Their idealisations have assumed another
form, but the researches of modern science have only
established their universality and truth.</p>

<p>The great agents at work in nature&mdash;the mighty
spirits bound to never-ending tasks, which they pursue
with unremitting toil, are of so refined a character, that
they will probably remain for ever unknown to us. The
arch-evocator, with the wand of induction, calls; but
the only answer to his evocation is the manifestation of
power in startling effects. Science pursues her inquiries
with zeal and care: she tries and tortures nature to
compel her to reveal her secrets. Bounds are, however,
set to the powers of mortal search: we may not yet
have reached the limits within which we are free to
exercise our mental strength; but, those limits reached,
we shall find an infinite region beyond us, into which
even conjecture wanders eyeless and aimless, as the blind
Cyclops groping in his melancholy cave.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>All we know of heat is, that striking effects are produced
which we measure by sensation, and by instruments
upon which we have observed that given results
will be produced under certain conditions: of anything
approaching to the cause of these we are totally ignorant.
The wonder-working mover of some of the
grandest phenomena in nature&mdash;giving health to the
organic world, and form to the inorganic mass&mdash;producing
genial gales and dire tornadoes&mdash;earthquake
strugglings and volcanic eruptions&mdash;ministering to our
comforts in the homely fire, and to advancement in
civilisation in the mighty furnace, and the ingenious
engine which drains our mines, or traverses our country
with bird-like speed,&mdash;will, in all probability, remain for
ever unknown to man. The immortal Newton, many
of whose guesses have a prophetic value, thus expresses
himself:&mdash;“Heat consists in a minute vibratory motion
in the particles of bodies, and this motion is communi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>cated
through an apparent vacuum by the undulations
of a very subtile elastic medium, which is also concerned
in the phenomena of light.”</p>

<p>Our experimental labours and our mathematical
investigations have considerably advanced our knowledge
since the time of Newton; yet still each theory of
heat strangely resembles the mystic lamp which the
Rosicrucian regarded as a type of eternal life&mdash;a dim
and flickering symbol, in the tongue-like flame of which
imagination, like a child, can conjure many shapes.</p>

<p>Modern theory regards heat as a manifestation of
motion, and experiment proves that a body falling
through a certain space generates a definite quantity of
heat, while observation shows that the waters at the
base of the Falls of Niagara possess a temperature 1°
higher than when they first glide over the edge of the
precipice.</p>

<p>This increase of temperature is due to the mechanical
force due to the fall, and is no more an evidence of the
conversion of motion into heat, than is the old experiment
of rubbing a button until it becomes hot. At all
events, the fact that a given amount of mechanical force
always produces an equivalent of heat is as applicable to
the idea of a “subtile elastic medium” which is diffused
through all matter, as to the, at present, favourite hypothesis.</p>

<p>So far has this view been strained, that the temperature
of the planets has been referred to their motions,
and speculation has aided the mathematician in determining
the cessation of planetary motion, by the conversion
of it into heat. It is true that other theorists have
supposed points in space upon which this heat might be
concentrated and reflected back again to produce motion.</p>

<p>There may be much of the poetic element in such
speculations, but it is of that order which belongs rather
to the romantic than to the real.</p>

<p>A speculation which has more of truth, and which is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
indeed, demonstrable, cannot fail to impress every mind
with its beauty, and probable correctness.</p>

<p>In the growth of a tree, its wood and all its products
are the result of certain external forces effecting chemical
changes. Carbonic acid is decomposed, the carbon
is retained, and oxygen given off, and assimilations of a
complex character are in constant progress to produce
the various compounds of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
and carbon.</p>

<p>Every condition of organised forms is due to the external
excitation of light and heat, and in the chemical
changes which take place, an equivalent of these principles,
or powers&mdash;it signifies but little according to which
view we may regard them&mdash;is absorbed, and retained as
essential to the condition of the matter formed. Let us
confine our attention to wood&mdash;although the position
applies equally to every organic product. A cubic foot
of wood is formed by the decomposition of a certain
quantity of carbonic acid, by the vital function of the
plant, excited by the solar rays, which are involved in
the mass which nature by “her wondrous alchemy” has
made. Eventually this cubic foot of wood is subjected
to a process of chemical change&mdash;combustion; by the
application of a single spark,&mdash;and in the disintegration
of the wood, its carbon combining with oxygen to form
carbonic acid, its hydrogen to form water, which is returned
to the air, a large amount of light and heat is produced.
This is exactly equivalent to the amount which
was engaged in its formation. Indeed, the sunshine which
fell upon the leaves of the forest tree, of which the log
formed a part, has been hoarded up, and we again develope
it in its original state of heat and light.</p>

<p>The vast coal beds of England were formed by the
rapid growth and quick decay of a peculiar class of
plants under the influence of a tropical sun. They have
been buried myriads of ages, under hundreds of feet of
sandy rock. By the industry of the miner the coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
is brought again to the surface, and we develope from
it those powers by which it was formed.</p>

<p>In the fire which gives comfort to our homes&mdash;in the
furnace which generates force for the purposes of manufacture,
or to propel the railway engine and its ponderous
train&mdash;in the gas with which we illumine our streets
and gladden during the long winter nights our apartments,
we are developing that heat and light which fell
upon the earth with all its quickening influences millions
of ages before yet the Creator had called into
existence the monarch Man, for whose necessities these
wondrous formations were designed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> “The physical characters of this species of glass, which
acts so differently from the other species of coloured glass in all
the phenomena of calorific absorption, are, 1st, its intercepting
almost totally the rays which pass through alum; 2nd, its entirely
absorbing the red rays of the solar spectrum. I have already
stated that their colouration is produced almost entirely by the
oxide of copper.
</p>
<p>
“Thus, the colouring matters of the coloured glasses, while
they so powerfully affect the relations of quantity which the different
rays of ordinary light bear to each other, exercise no elective
action on the concomitant calorific rays. This curious
phenomenon is the more remarkable as the colouring matters
absorb almost always a very considerable portion of the heat
<i>naturally transmitted by the glass</i>. The following are, in fact, the
calorific transmissions of the seven coloured glasses referred to;
the transmission of the common glass being represented by
100; red glass, 82·5; orange, 72·5; yellow, 55; bluish-green,
57·5; blue, 52·5; indigo, 30; violet, 85. The quantity of
heat absorbed through the action of the colouring substances is,
therefore, 17·5 in the red glass, 27·5 in the orange, 45 in the
yellow, 42·5 in the green, 47·5 in the blue, 70 in the indigo,
and 15 in the violet. Now, as these absorptions extinguish a
proportional part of each of the rays which constitute the calorific
stream transmitted by common glass, they may be compared,
as we said before, with the absorbent action exercised on light
by matters more or less deeply brown or dark, when they are
immersed in water, or some other colourless liquid which dissolves,
but does not affect them chemically.”&mdash;<i>Annales de Chimie
et de Physique</i>, tom. xl. p. 382.
</p>
<p>
Guided by these principles, the author selected the glass
employed in glazing the Royal Palm-House, at Kew Botanical
Gardens, where it was desired to obstruct the passage of those
rays which have a particular scorching influence. Of this glass
a description was given at the meeting of the British Association
at Oxford, which appears in the Transactions for that year. The
result has been all that could be desired&mdash;not a single instance of
scorching having occurred during the three years which have elapsed.</p></div>

<i>Investigation of the powers of the prismatic colours to heat and

In connection with this inquiry, Sir William Herschel remarks,
that since a <i>red glass</i> stops no less than 692 out of 1,000 such
rays as are of the refrangibility of red light, we have a direct
and simple proof, in the case of the red glass, that the rays of
light are transmitted, while those of heat are stopped, and that
thus they have nothing in common but a certain equal degree of
refrangibility, which by the power of the glass must occasion
them to be thrown together into the place which is pointed out to
us by the visibility of the rays of light.

Sir Isaac Newton fixed the temperature at which bodies become
self-luminous at 635°; Sir Humphry Davy at 812°; Mr.

In a review of the above paper by Melloni, entitled <i>Researches
on the Radiations of Incandescent Bodies, and on the Elementary
Colours of the Solar Spectrum</i>, translated for Silliman’s Journal
for August, 1847, he remarks:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“I say that they conduct, as do others heretofore known on
light and radiant heat, to a perfect analogy between the general
laws which govern these two great agents of nature. I will add
that I regard the theory of their identity as the only one admissible
by the rules of philosophy; and that I consider myself
obliged to adopt it, until it shall have been proved to me that
there is a necessity of having recourse to two different principles,
for the explanation of a series of phenomena which at present
appear to belong to a solitary agent.”
</p>
<p>
Reference should also be made to a paper by Dr. Robinson,
<i>On the effects of Heat in lessening the Affinities of the Elements
of Water</i>, in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,
1848, where he says that “when a platinum wire is traversed by
a current gradually increased till it produces ignition, the first
gleam that appears is not red, but of a colour which, when I
first saw it, I compared to the ‘lavender ray’ discovered by Sir
John Herschel beyond the violet, though I was surprised at
seeing the tint of that most refrangible ray preceding the ray
which is least so. It is quite conspicuous at about 865°; and
as the mode in which it makes its appearance presents nothing
abrupt or discontinuous, it seems likely that it is merely a
transition from invisible rays excited at a lower temperature
to ordinary light.”&mdash;p. 310.</p></div>

most complete investigation of this subject.
</p>
<p>
The experiments were, for the most part, made in Switzerland
with Sir John Herschel’s actinometer, and they prove satisfactorily,&mdash;“That
the absorption of the solar rays by the strata

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> After referring to several curious and instructive experiments,
in which peculiar chemical changes are produced under the influence
of the solar rays by their <span class="smcap">Heat</span>, Sir John Herschel says:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“These rays are distinguished from those of Light by being
invisible; they are also distinguished from the pure calorific rays
beyond the spectrum, by their possessing properties (<i>of a peculiar
character, referred to in former papers</i>) either exclusively of the
calorific rays, or in a much higher degree. They may perhaps not
improperly be regarded as bearing the same relation to the calorific
spectrum which the photographic rays do to the luminous ones.
If the restriction to these rays of the term <i>thermic</i>, as distinct
from <i>calorific</i>, be not (as I think, in fact, it is not) a sufficient
distinction, I would propose the term <i>parathermic rays</i> to designate
them. These are the rays which I conceive to be active in producing
those singular molecular affections which determine the
precipitation of vapours in the experiments of Messrs. Draper,
Moser, and Hunt, and which will probably lead to important discoveries
as to the intimate nature of those forces resident on the
surfaces of bodies, to which M. Dutrochet has given the name of epipolic
forces.”&mdash;<i>On certain improvements in Photographic Processes, described
in a former communication</i> (Phil. Trans, vol. cxxxiii.); and

</p>
<p>
The experiments of Mrs. Somerville, <i>On the Action of the Rays
of the Spectrum on Vegetable Juices</i> (Phil. Transactions, vol.
cxxxvii.), appear to connect themselves with this particular class
of rays in a curious manner.</p></div>

Dew was employed by the alchemists in their experiments on the
solution of gold. The ladies of old collected the “celestial wash,”
which they imagined had the virtue of preserving their fine forms,
by exposing heaps of wool to the influences of night radiation. It
was supposed that the lean features of the grasshopper arose from
that insect feeding entirely on dew: “Dumque thymo pascentur

of man. Aristotle, in his book <i>De Mundo</i>, puts forth some just
notions on its nature. An opinion has almost always prevailed
that dew falls. Gersten appears to have been the first who opposed
this motion. He was followed by <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Muschenbroek">Musschenbroek</span>, and then by
Du Fay. The researches of Leslie were of a far more exact character.
Dr. Wilson, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of

interest; but the questions involved remained unsettled until the
researches of Dr. Wells, which were published in his <i>Essay on Dew</i>.</p></div>

were employed, and the observations made with sedulous care.

Goldsworthy Gurney has made a series of interesting experiments,
and he imagines that by shading grasslands with boughs of trees,
or any light litter, a more abundant crop is produced. The subject
has been discussed in the journals of the Royal Agricultural

succulent condition in which a plant always grows in the shade?</p></div>

the relations of heat, like light, to the coloured rays of the
spectrum. This, it must be remembered, is not the case, since
even Sir William Herschel showed that red light might exist with
only a minimum of calorific power, notwithstanding the fact, that
the maximum heat-ray of the spectrum coincides with the red rays.</p></div>

at by M. Delaroche:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. Invisible radiant heat may, in some circumstances, pass
directly through glass.
</p>
<p>
2. The quantity of radiant heat which passes directly through
glass is so much greater, relative to the whole heat emitted in
the same direction, as the temperature of the source of heat is
more elevated.
</p>
<p>
3. The calorific rays which have already passed through a
screen of glass, experience, in passing through a second glass
screen of a similar nature, a much smaller diminution of their
intensity than they did in passing through the first screen.
</p>
<p>
4. The rays emitted by a hot body differ from each other in
their faculty to pass through glass.
</p>
<p>
5. A thick glass, though as much or more permeable to light
than a thin glass of worse quality, allows a much smaller quantity
of radiant heat to pass. The difference is so much the less as
the temperature of the radiating source is more elevated.
</p>
<p>
6. The quantity of heat which a hot body yields in a given
time, by radiation to a cold body situate at a distance, increases,
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, in a greater ratio than the excess of temperature of
the first body above the second.&mdash;Journal de Physique, vol. lxxv.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Sir David Brewster differs from the conclusions arrived
at by Delaroche. He thus explains his views:&mdash;“The inability
of radiant heat to pass through glass, may be considered as a
consequence of its refusing to yield to the refractive force;
for we can scarcely conceive a particle of radiant matter freely
permeating a solid body, without suffering some change in its
velocity and direction. The ingenious experiments of M. Prévost,
of Geneva, and the more recent ones of M. Delaroche, have been
considered as establishing the permeability of glass to radiant
heat. M. Prévost employed moveable screens of glass, and renewed
them continually, in order that the result which he obtained
might not be ascribed to the heating of the screen; but
such is the rapidity with which heat is propagated through a
thin plate of glass, that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible,
to observe the state of the thermometer before it has been
affected by the secondary radiation from the screen. The method
employed by M. Delaroche, of observing the difference of effect,
when a blackened glass screen and a transparent one were made
successively to intercept the radiant heat, is liable to an obvious
error. The radiant heat would find a quicker passage through
the transparent screen; and, therefore, the difference of effect
was not due to the transmitted heat, but to the heat radiated
from the anterior surface. The truth contained in M. Delaroche’s
fifth proposition is almost a demonstration of the fallacy of all
those that precede it. He found that ‘a thick plate of glass,
though as much or more permeable to light than a thin glass of
worse quality, allowed a much smaller quantity of radiant heat
to pass.’ If he had employed very thick plates of the purest
flint glass, or thick masses of fluid that have the power of transmitting
light copiously, he would have found that not a single
particle of heat was capable of passing directly through transparent
media.”&mdash;Sir D. Brewster, <i>On new properties of heat as exhibited
in its propagation along plates of glass</i>. Philosophical
Transactions, vol. cvi. p. 107.</p></div>

the immaterial theory leads to, cannot be better exemplified than
by the following quotation from that inexplicable dream of a
talented man, <i>Elements of Physiophilosophy</i>, by Lorenz Oken, M.D.
(translated for the Ray Society, by Alfred Tulk):&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Heat is not matter itself any more than light is; but it is
only the act of motion in the primary matter. In heat, as well
as in light, there certainly resides a material substratum; yet,
this substratum does not give out heat and light; but the <i>motion</i>
only of the substratum gives out heat, and the <i>tension</i> only of
the substratum light. There is no body of heat; nitrogen is
the body of heat, just as oxygen may be called the body of fire.
Heat is real space; into it all forms have been resolved, as all
materiality has been resolved into gravity, and all activity, all
polarity, into light. Heat is the universal form, consequently the
want of form.”</p></div>

longer than that of the intermediate portions.

The proof of the continuation of the visible prismatic spectrum
beyond the extreme violet may be witnessed in the following
manner:&mdash;“Paper stained with tincture of turmeric is of a yellow
colour; and, in consequence, the spectrum thrown in it, if exposed
in open daylight, is considerably affected in its apparent
colours, the blue portion appearing violet, and the violet very
pale and faint; but beyond the region occupied by the violet
rays, is distinctly to be seen a faint prolongation of the spectrum,
terminated laterally, like the rest of it, by straight and sharp outlines,
and which, in this case, affects the eye with the sensation of
a pale yellow colour.”&mdash;Philosophical Transactions, p. 133.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> The most complete exposition of the theory that animal heat
is derived from chemical action only, will be found in <i>Animal
Chemistry, or Chemistry in its applications to Physiology and
Pathology</i>, by Justus Liebig: translated by Dr. Gregory. The
conclusions arrived at by the author, notwithstanding his high&mdash;and
deservedly high&mdash;position in chemical science, must, however,
be received with great caution, many of them being founded on
most incorrect premises, and his generalizations being of the most
hasty and imperfect character. At page 22 the following passage
occurs:&mdash;“If we were to go naked, like certain savage tribes, or if
in hunting or fishing we were exposed to the same degree of cold
as the Samoiedes, we should be able, with ease, to consume ten
pounds of flesh, and, perhaps, a dozen of tallow candles into the
bargain, daily, as warmly clad travellers have related with astonishment
of these people. We should then also be able to take the
same quantity of brandy or train-oil without bad effects, because
the carbon and hydrogen of these substances would only suffice to
keep up the equilibrium between the external temperature and
that of our bodies.”
</p>
<p>
A brief examination will exhibit the error of this. The analysis
of Beef, by D. Lyon Playfair, is as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<table summary="Chemical analysis of beef">
<tr><td>Carbon</td><td class="tdr tdpad">51·83</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hydrogen</td><td class="tdr tdpad">7·57</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nitrogen</td><td class="tdr tdpad">15·01</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oxygen</td><td class="tdr tdpad">21·37</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ashes</td><td class="tdr tdpad">4·23</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
And the following has been given by Chevreul as the composition
of mutton tallow:&mdash;
</p>
<table summary="Chemical analysis of mutton tallow">
<tr><td>Carbon</td><td class="tdr tdpad">96</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hydrogen</td><td class="tdr tdpad">16</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nitrogen</td><td class="tdr tdpad">16</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oxygen</td><td class="tdr tdpad">48</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
About three times the quantity of oxygen to the carbon eaten, is
required to convert it into carbonic acid; hence, the Samoiede,
eating more highly carbonized matter, must inspire 288 oz. of
oxygen daily, or nearly eight times as much as the “ordinary
adult.” By the lungs he must take into the body 2,304 cubic
feet of air besides what will be absorbed by the skin. His
respirations must be so much quickened, that at the lowest possible
calculation he must have 500 pulsations a minute. Under
such conditions it is quite clear man could not exist. There is
no disputing the fact of the enormous appetites of these people;

<p>
The three following conclusions are arrived at:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. Que l’alcool à 36 degrés, l’essence de pétrole rectifiée à 42
degrés, et l’éther sulfurique soumis à l’action de la chaleur et
de la compression, sont susceptibles de se réduire complètement
en vapeur sous un volume un peu plus que double de celui de
chaque liquide.

2. Qu’une augmentation de pression, occasionnée par la présence
de l’air dans plusieurs des experiences qui viennent d’être
citées, n’a point apporté d’obstacle à l’évaporation du liquide
dans le même espace; qu’elle a seulement rendu sa dilatation plus
calme et plus facile à suivre jusqu’au moment où le liquide
semble s’évanouir tout-à-coup.
</p>
<p>
3. Que l’eau, quoique susceptible sans doute d’être réduite
en vapeur très-comprimée, n’a pu être soumise à des experiences
complètes, faute de moyens suffisans pour assurer l’exacte fermeture
de la marmite de compression, non plus que dans les tubes

<p class="p2">Light, the first creation, presents to the enquiring
mind a series of phenomena of the most exalted character.
The glowing sunshine, painting the earth with
all the brilliancy of colour, and giving to the landscape
the inimitable charm of every degree of illumination,
from the grey shadow to the golden glow;&mdash;the calm of
evening, when, weary of the “excess of splendour,” the
eye can repose in tranquillity upon the “cloud-land”
of the west, and watch the golden and the ruddy hues
fade slowly into the blue tincture of night;&mdash;and the
pale refulgence of the moon, with the quiet sparkle of
the sun-lit stars,&mdash;all tend to impress upon the soul, the
great truth that, where there is light, organisation and
life are found, and beyond its influence death and silence
hold supreme dominion.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Through all time we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
evidences that this has been the prevailing feeling of the
human race, derived, of course, from their observation of
the natural phenomena dependent upon luminous agency.
In the myths of every country, impersonations of light
prevail, and to these are referred the mysteries of the
perpetual renewal of life on the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>This presentiment of a philosophic truth, in the instance
of the poet sages of intellectual Greece, was advanced
to the highest degree of refinement; and the
sublime exclamation of Plato: “Light is truth, and God
is light,” approaches nearly to a divine revelation.</p>

<p>As the medium of vision&mdash;as the cause of colour&mdash;as
a power influencing in a most striking manner all the
forms of organisation around us, light presented to the
inquiring minds of all ages a subject of the highest
interest.</p>

<p>The ancient philosophers, although they lost themselves
in the metaphysical subtleties of their schools,
could not but discover in light an element of the utmost
importance in natural operations. The alchemists regarded
the luminous principle as a most subtile fluid,
capable of interpenetrating and mingling with gross
matter: gold being supposed to differ from the baser
metals only in containing a larger quantity of this ethereal
essence.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Modern science, after investigating most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
attentively a greater number of the phenomena of light,
has endeavoured to assist the inquiry by the aid of
hypotheses. Newton, in a theory, which exhibits the
refined character of that great philosopher’s mind, supposes
luminous particles to dart from the surfaces of
bodies in all directions&mdash;that these infinitely minute particles
are influenced by the attracting and repelling forces
of matter, and thus turned back, or reflected, from their
superficies in some cases, and absorbed into their interstitial
spaces in others.</p>

<p>Huyghens, on the contrary, supposes light to be caused
by the waves or vibrations of an infinitely elastic medium&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ether</span>&mdash;diffused
through all space, which waves are
propagated in every direction from the luminous body.
In the first theory, a luminous particle is supposed actually
to come from the sun to the earth; in the other,
the sun only occasions a disturbance of the <i>ether</i>, which
extends with great rapidity, in the same manner as a
wave spreads itself over the surface of a lake.</p>

<p>Nearly all the facts known in the time of Newton,
and those discovered by him, were explained most
satisfactorily by his hypothesis; but it was found they
could be interpreted equally as the effects of undulation,
with the exception of the production of colour by prismatic
refraction. Although the labours of many
gifted minds have been given, with the utmost devotion,
to the support of the vibratory theory, this simple fact
has never yet received any satisfactory explanation; and
there are numerous discoveries connected with the molecular
and chemical disturbances produced by the su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>n’s
rays, which do not appear to be explained by the hypothesis
of emission or of undulation.</p>

<p>In both theories a wave motion is admitted, and every
fact renders it probable that this mode of progression
applies not only to light, but to the so-called <i>imponderable
forces</i> in general. Admitting, therefore, the undulatory
movement of luminous rays, we shall not stop to
consider those points of the discussion which have been
so ably dealt with by Young, Laplace, Fresnel, Biot,
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Frauenhofer">Fraunhofer</span>, Herschel, Brewster, and others, but proceed
at once to consider the sources of light, and its
more remarkable phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The sun is the greatest permanently luminous body
we are acquainted with, and that orb is continually pouring
off light from its surface in all directions at the rate,
through the resisting medium of space and of our own
atmosphere, of 192,000 miles in a second of time. It has
been calculated, however, that light would move through
a vacuum with the speed of 192,500 miles in the same
period. We, therefore, learn that a ray of light requires
eight minutes and thirteen seconds to come from the sun
to us. In travelling from the distant planet Uranus,
nearly three hours are exhausted; and from the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
of the fixed stars each ray of light requires more than
six years to traverse the intervening space between it
and the earth. Allow the mind to advance to the
regions of nebulæ, and it will be found that hundreds of
years must glide away during the passage of their radiations.
Consequently, if one of those masses of matter, or
even one of the remote fixed stars, was “blotted out of
heaven” to-day, several generations of the finite inhabitants
of this world would fade out of time before the
obliteration could be known to man. Here the immensity
of space assists us in our conception, limited though
it be, of the for-ever of eternity.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>All the planets of our system shine with reflected
light, and the moon, our satellite, also owes her silvery
lustre to the sun’s radiations. The fixed stars are, in
all probability, suns shining from the far distance of
space, with their own self-emitted lights. By the photometric
researches of Dr. Wollaston, we learn, however,
that it would take 20,000 millions of such orbs as Sirius,
the brightest of the fixed stars, to afford as much light
as we derive from the sun. The same observer has
proved that the brightest effulgence of the full moon is
yet 801,072 times less than the luminous power of our
solar centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>The cultivators of modern science are a bold race; not
contented with endeavouring to understand the physical
earth, they are endeavouring to comprehend the condition
of the solar surface. The mind of man can penetrate
far into nature, and, as it were, feel out the mysteries
of untraversed space. The astronomer learns of
a peculiar condition of light, which is termed polarisation,
and he learns by this, too, that he can determine if
from a bright luminous disc the light is derived from a
solid mass in a state of intense ignition, or from vapour
in an incandescent condition. He adds a polarising apparatus
to his telescopes, and he determines that the
light we derive from the sun is due to an envelope of
vapour&mdash;burning, in all probability&mdash;only with greater
intensity, as the gas which we now employ. This <i>Photosphere</i>&mdash;as
it has been called by the late French philosopher
Arago, is found to be subjected to violent disturbances,
and the dark spots seen on the sun’s disc are now
known to be openings through this mysterious envelope
of light, which enable us to look in upon the dark body
of the sun itself.</p>

<p>Luminous phenomena may be produced by various
means&mdash;chemical action is a source of light; and, under
several circumstances in which the laws of affinity are
strongly exerted, a very intense luminous effect is produced.
Under this head all the phenomena of combustion
are included. In the electric spark we have the
development of light; and the arc which is formed
between charcoal points <span class="correction" title="In the original book: a">at</span> the poles of a powerful voltaic
battery affords us the most intense artificial illumination
with which we are acquainted. In addition to these, we
have the peculiar phenomena of phosphorescence arising
from chemical, calorific, electrical, actinic, and vital excitation,
all of which must be particularly examined.</p>

<p>From whatever source we procure light, it is the same
in character, differing only in intensity. In its action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
upon matter, we have the phenomena of transmission, of
reflection, of refraction, of colour, of polarisation, and of
vision, to engage our attention.</p>

<p>A beam of white light falls upon a plate of colourless
glass, and it passes freely through it, losing but little of
its intensity; the largest portion being lost by reflection
from the first surface upon which the light impinges. If
the glass is roughened by grinding, we lose more light
by absorption and by reflection from the asperities of
the roughened surface; but if we cover that face with
any oleaginous fluid, as, for instance, turpentine, its
transparency is restored. We have thus direct proof
that transparency to light is due to molecular condition.
This may be most strikingly shown by an interesting
experiment of Sir David Brewster’s:&mdash;</p>

<p>If a glass tube is filled with nitrous acid vapour, which
is of a dull red colour, it admits freely the passage of
the red and orange rays with some of the others, and, if
held upright in the sunshine, casts a red shadow on the
ground; by gently warming it with a spirit-lamp, whilst
in this position, it acquires a much deeper and blacker
colour, and becomes almost impervious to any of the
rays of light; but upon cooling it again recovers its
transparency.</p>

<p>It has also been stated by the same exact experimentalist,
that having brought a purple glass to a red heat,
its transparency was improved, so that it transmitted
green, yellow, and red rays, which it previously absorbed;
but the glass recovered its absorptive powers as
it cooled. A piece of yellowish-green glass lost its
transparency almost entirely by being heated. Native
yellow orpiment becomes blood-red upon being warmed,
when nearly all but the red rays are absorbed; and pure
phosphorus, which is of a pale yellow colour, and transmits
freely all the coloured rays upon being melted, becomes
very dark, and transmits no light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Chemistry affords numerous examples of a very slight
change of condition, producing absolute opacity in fluids
which were previously diaphanous.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Charcoal absorbs all the light which falls upon it, but
in some of its states of combination, and in the diamond,
which is pure carbon, it is highly transparent. Gold
and silver beaten into thin leaves are permeated by the
green and blue rays, and the metals in combination with
acids are all of them more or less transparent. What
becomes of the light which falls upon and is absorbed
by bodies, is a question which we cannot yet, notwithstanding
the extensive observations that have been made
by some of the most gifted of men, answer satisfactorily.
In all probability, as already stated, it is permanently
retained within their substances; and many of the experiments
of exciting light in bodies when in perfect darkness,
by the electric spark and other means, appear to
support the idea of light becoming latent or hidden.</p>

<p>No body is absolutely transparent; some light is lost
in passing even through ethereal space, and still more in
traversing our atmosphere.</p>

<p>Amongst the most curious instances of absorption is
that which is uniformly discovered in the solar spectrum,
particularly when we examine it with a telescope. We
then find that the coloured rays are crossed by a great
number of dark bands or lines, giving no light; these
are generally called Fraunhofer’s dark lines, as it was to
the indefatigable exertions of that experimentalist, and
by the aid of his beautiful instruments, that most of them
were discovered and measured, and enumerated, although
they were previously noticed by Dr. Wollaston. It is
quite clear that those lines represent rays which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
been absorbed in their passage from the sun to the earth:
although some of them have no doubt undergone absorption
within the limits of the earth’s atmosphere, we
have every reason to believe, with Sir John Herschel,
that the principal absorption takes place in the atmosphere
of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>It has been proved by Dr. Miller, that the number of
those dark lines is continually varying with the alteration
of atmospheric conditions;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and the evidences
which have been afforded, of peculiar states of absorption
by the gaseous envelope of the earth,&mdash;during the
prosecution of investigations on the chemical agencies
of the sun’s rays,&mdash;are of a sufficiently convincing character.</p>

<p>It has been calculated by Bouguer, that if our atmosphere,
in its purest state, could be extended rather more
than 700 miles from the earth’s surface instead of nearly
40, as it is at present, the sun’s rays could not penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
it, and this globe would roll on in darkness and silence,
without a vestige of vegetable form or of animal life. In
the Hebrew version of the Mosaic History, the reading
is, “Let light appear:” may not this really mean that
the earth’s atmosphere was so cleared of obstructing
vapours, that the solar rays were enabled to reach the
earth? The same calculation supposes that sea-water
loses all its transparency at the depth of 730 feet; but
a dim twilight must prevail much deeper in the ocean.</p>

<p>The researches of Professor Edward Forbes have
proved, that at the depth of 230 fathoms in the Ægean
sea, the few shelled animals that exist are colourless: no
plants are found within that zone; and that industrious
naturalist fixes the zero of animal life of those waters at
about 300 fathoms.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Since these zones mark the rapidly
diminishing light, it is evident that where life ceases to be
must be beyond the limits to which life can penetrate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span></p>
<p>Our atmosphere, charged with aqueous vapour, serves
to shield us from the intense action of the solar powers.
By it we are protected from the destructive influences
of the sun’s light and heat; enjoy those modified
conditions which are most conducive to the healthful
being of organic forms; to it we owe “the blue sky
bending over all,” and those beauties of morning and
evening twilight of which</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&mdash;&mdash; Sound and motion own the potent sway.</div>
<div class="verse">Responding to the charm with its own mystery.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To defective transparency, or rather to the different
degrees of it, we must attribute, in part, the colours of
permeable media. Thus, a glass or fluid appears yellow
to the eye, because it has the property of admitting the
permeation of a larger quantity of the yellow rays than
of any others;&mdash;red, because the red rays pass it with
the greatest freedom; and so on for every other colour.
In most cases the powers of transmission and of reflection
are similar; but it is not so in all; a variety of fluor
spar, which, while it transmits green light, reflects blue,
and the precious opal, are striking instances to the contrary.
Some glasses, which transmit yellow light have
the singular power of dispersing blue rays from one sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>face;
and a solution of quinine in water acidulated with
sulphuric acid, although perfectly transparent and colourless
when held between the eye and the light, exhibits,
if viewed in a particular direction, a lively cerulean tint.
These effects being supposed to be due to the conditions
of the surface, have been called <i>epipolic</i> phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The careful investigation of these phenomena has
made us acquainted with some very interesting facts, and
indeed discovered to us a set of luminous rays which
were previously unknown. The dispersion of blue light
from the surface of some yellow glasses&mdash;such as have been
coloured by the oxide of silver&mdash;is of a different order
from that which takes place with the solution of sulphate
of quinine, or with the fluor spar. The first depends
upon a peculiar condition of the surface, while the latter
phenomena are due to a dispersion which takes place
<i>within</i> the solid or fluid. In addition to the sulphate
of quinine, and the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: flour">fluor</span> spar, we obtain the same results
in a very marked manner by a canary yellow glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
coloured with the oxide of uranium, and by a decoction
of the inner bark of the horse-chesnut tree. Mr.
Stokes, who has investigated this class of phenomena,
and proposes to call it <i>Fluorescence</i>, from its being naturally
seen in fluor-spar, has shown that the peculiar internal
dispersion, and the consequent alteration of the colour
of the ray, is due to an alteration in its refrangibility.
Whether this hypothesis prove to be the correct one or
not, it is certain that there exists a set of rays of far
higher refrangibility than those seen in the ordinary
Newtonian spectrum. This may be shown in the following
manner: taking either of the solutions named, or a
block of uranium glass, throw upon one face, by means of
a prism, a very pure spectrum. On looking <i>into</i> the
glass or fluid there will be seen, commencing amidst the
most refrangible rays, a new set of spectral rays, struggling
to make their way through the absorbent medium.
These are of a blue colour in the quinine or chesnut
solution, and green in the uranium glass, and are seen
extending themselves far beyond the most refrangible
rays of the ordinary Newtonian spectrum. This is the
space over which those rays which have the power of producing
chemical changes, such as are rendered familiar
by the practice of Photography, are detected in their
greatest activity. It has, therefore, been supposed that
these fluorescent rays are the chemical rays rendered luminous
by the alteration of their refrangibility. This
view has received much support from the fact that the
extra spectral rays are crossed with numerous dark
lines, and that in the chemical impressions these
lines are marked by unchanged spaces which exactly
coincide with them. There is, however, much doubt of
the correctness of this, since, in the uranium glass of
such a thickness that these visible rays are quite absorbed,
the chemical rays still pass.</p>

<p>However, the whole question requires, and is receiving,
the most searching investigation. The discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
these phenomena, which are included under the term of
Fluorescence, is of that interesting and important character,
that it must be ranked as the most decided advance
which has been made in physical optics since the
days of Newton.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that those rays of such high
refrangibility may, although they are under ordinary
circumstances invisible to the human eye, be adapted
to produce the necessary degree of excitement upon
which vision depends in the optic nerves of the night-roaming
animals. The bat, the owl, and the cat, may
see in the gloom of night by the aid of rays which are
invisible to, or inactive on the eyes of man, or of those
animals which require the light of day for perfect vision.</p>

<p>It is a general law of the radiant forces, that whenever
they fall upon any surface, a portion is thrown
back or reflected at the same time as other portions are
absorbed or transmitted. Upon this peculiarity appear
to depend the phenomena of natural colour in bodies.</p>

<p>The white light of the sun is well known to be composed
of several coloured rays. Or rather, according to
the theory of undulations, when the rate at which a ray
vibrates is altered, a different sensation is produced upon
the optic nerve. The analytical examination of this
question shows, that to produce a red colour the ray of
light must give 37,640 undulations in an inch, and
458,000000,000000 in a second. Yellow light requires
44,000 undulations in an inch, and 535,000000,000000
in a second; whilst the effect of blue results from 51,110
undulations within an inch, and 622,000000,000000 of
waves in a second of time.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The determination of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
points as these is among the highest refinements of
science, and, when contrasted with the most sublime
efforts of the imagination, they must appear immeasurably
superior.</p>

<p>If a body sends back white light unchanged, it appears
white; if the surface has the property of altering the
vibration to that degree which is calculated to produce
redness, the result is a red colour: the annihilation of
the undulations produces blackness. By the other view,
or the corpuscular hypothesis, the beam of white light
is supposed to consist of certain coloured rays, each of
which has physical properties peculiar to itself, and thus
is capable of producing different physiological effects.
These rays falling upon a transparent or an opaque body
suffer more or less absorption, and being thus dissevered,
we have the effect of colour. A red body absorbs all
the rays but the red; a blue surface, all but the blue;
a yellow, all but the yellow; and a black surface absorbs
the whole of the light which falls upon it.</p>

<p>That natural colours are the result of white light, and
not innate properties of the bodies themselves, is most
conclusively shown by placing coloured bodies in monochromatic
light of another kind, when they will appear
either of the colour of that light, or, by absorbing it,
become black; whereas, when placed in light of their
own character, the intensity of colour is greatly increasing.</p>

<p>Every surface has, therefore, a peculiar constitution,
by which it gives rise to the diversified hues of nature.
The rich and lively green, which so abundantly overspreads
the surface of the earth, the varied colours of
the flowers, and the numberless tints of animals, together
with all those of the productions of the mineral
kingdom, and of the artificial combinations of chemical
manufacture, result from powers by which the relations
of matter to light are rendered permanent, until its physical
conditions undergo some change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>There is a remarkable correspondence between the
geographical position of a region and the colours of its
plants and animals. Within the tropics, where</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The sun shines for ever unchangeably bright,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the darkest green prevails over the leaves of plants; the
flowers and fruits are tinctured with colours of the
deepest dye, whilst the plumage of the birds is of the
most variegated description and of the richest hues. In
the people also of these climes there is manifested a
desire for the most striking colours, and their dresses
have all a distinguishing character, not of shape merely,
but of chromatic arrangement. In the temperate
climates everything is of a more subdued variety: the
flowers are less bright of hue; the prevailing tint of the
winged tribes is a russet brown; and the dresses of the
inhabitants of these regions are of a sombre character.
In the colder portions of the earth there is but little
colour; the flowers are generally white or yellow, and
the animals exhibit no other contrast than that which
white and black afford. A chromatic scale might be
formed, its maximum point being at the equator, and its
minimum at the poles.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The influence of light on the colours of organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
creation is well shown in the sea. Near the shores we
find sea-weeds of the most beautiful hues, particularly
on the rocks which are left dry by the tides;
and the rich tints of the actiniæ, which inhabit shallow
water, must have been often observed. The fishes which
swim near the surface are also distinguished by the
variety of their colours, whereas those which live at
greater depths are grey, brown, or black. It has been
found that after a certain depth, where the quantity of
light is so reduced that a mere twilight prevails, the
inhabitants of the ocean become nearly colourless.
That the sun’s ray alone gives to plants the property of
reflecting colour is proved by the process of blanching,
or <i>etiolation</i>, produced by artificially excluding the light.</p>

<p>By a triangular piece of glass&mdash;a prism,&mdash;we are enabled
to resolve light into its ultimate rays. The white pencil
of light which falls on the first surface of the prism is
bent from its path, and coloured bands of different
colours are obtained. These bands or rays observe a
curious constancy in their positions: the red ray is
always the least bent out of the straight path: the
yellow class comes next in the order of refrangibility;
and the blue are the most diverted from the vertex of
the prism. The largest amount of illuminating power
exists in the yellow ray, and it diminishes towards either
end.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It is not uninteresting to observe something like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
the same variety of colour occurring at each end of the
prismatic spectrum. The strict order in which the pure
and mixed coloured rays present themselves is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>extreme red</i>: a ray which can only be discovered
when the eye is protected from the glare of the
other rays by a cobalt blue glass, is of a crimson
character&mdash;a mixture of the <i>red</i> and the <i>blue</i>, red
predominating.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>2. The <i>red</i>: the first ray visible under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>3. The <i>orange</i>: red passing into and combining with
yellow.</p>

<p>4. The <i>yellow</i>: the most intensely luminous of the
rays.</p>

<p>5. The <i>green</i>: the yellow passing into and blending
with the blue.</p>

<p>6. The <i>blue</i>: in which the light very rapidly diminishes.</p>

<p>7. The <i>indigo</i>: the dark intensity of blue.</p>

<p>8. The <i>violet</i>: the <i>blue</i> mingled again with the <i>red</i>&mdash;blue
being in excess.</p>

<p>9. The <i>lavender grey</i>: a neutral tint, produced by
the combination of the red, blue, and yellow rays, which
is discovered most easily when the spectrum is thrown
upon a sheet of turmeric paper.</p>

<p>10. The fluorescent rays: which are either a <i>pure
silvery blue</i> or a delicate <i>green</i>.</p>

<p>Newton regarded the spectrum as consisting of seven
colours of definite and unvarying refrangibility. Brewster
and others appear to have detected a great diffusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
of the colours over the spectrum, and regard white light as
consisting only of three rays, which in the prismatic images
overlap each other; and from these&mdash;red, yellow, and
blue&mdash;all the others can be formed by combination in
varying proportions. The truth will probably be found
to be, that the ordinary prismatic spectrum is a compound
of two spectra:&mdash;that is, as we have the ordinary
rainbow, and a supplementary bow, the colours of which
are inverted, so the extraordinary may be somewhat
masked by the intense light of the ordinary spectrum;
and yet by overlapping produce the variations of colour
in the rays. We have already examined the heating
power found in these coloured bands, which, although
shown to be in a remarkable manner in constant
agreement with the colour of a particular ray, is not
directly connected with it; that is, not as the effect
of a cause, or the contrary. The chemical action of the
solar rays, to which from its important bearings we shall
devote a separate chapter, has, in like manner with
heat, been confounded with the sun’s luminous power;
but although associated with light and heat, and modified
by their presence, it must be distinguished from
them.</p>

<p>We find the maximum of heat at one end of the
spectrum, and that of chemical excitation at the other&mdash;luminous
power observing a mean point between them.
Without doubt we have these powers acting reciprocally,
modifying all the phenomena of each other, and
thus giving rise to the difficulties which beset the inquirer
on every side.</p>

<p>We have beautiful natural illustrations of luminous
refraction in the rainbow and in the halo: in both cases
the rays of light being separated by the refractive power
of the falling rain drop, or the vesicles which form the
moisture constituting a fog. In the simple toy of the
child&mdash;the soap-bubble floating upon the air&mdash;the phi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>losopher
finds subjects for his contemplation; and from
the unrivalled play of colours which he discovers in
that attenuated film, he learns that the varying thicknesses
of surfaces influence, in a most remarkable
manner, the colours of the sunbeam. Films of oil
floating upon water present similar appearances; and
the colours developed in tempering steel are due entirely
to the thickness of the oxidized surface produced
by heat. There have lately been introduced some beautiful
specimens of paper rendered richly iridescent by the following
process:&mdash;A solution of a gum resin in chloroform
is floated upon water, where it forms a film giving all the
colours of Newton’s rings. A sheet of paper which
has been previously sunk in the water is carefully lifted,
and the film thus removed adheres with great firmness
to the paper, and produces this rich and curious play of
colour. The rich tints upon mother-of-pearl, in the
feathers of many birds, the rings seen in the cracks of
rock-crystal, or between the unequal faces of two pieces
of glass, and produced by many chemical and indeed
mechanical operations&mdash;are all owing to the same cause;&mdash;the
refraction of the luminous pencil by the condition
of the film or surface. If we take one of those steel
ornaments which are formed by being covered with an
immense number of fine lines, it will be evident that
these striæ present many different angles of reflection,
and that, consequently, the rays thrown back will, at
some point or another, have a tendency to cross each
other. The result of this is, that the quantity of light
is augmented at some points of intersection, and annihilated
at others.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Out of the investigation of the phenomena
of diffraction, of the effects of thin and thick
plates upon light, and the results of interference, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
arisen the discovery of one of the most remarkable conditions
within the range of physical science.</p>

<p><i>Two bright lights may be made to produce darkness.</i>&mdash;If
two pencils of light radiate from two spots very
close to each other in such a manner that they cross
each other at a given point, any object placed at that
line of interference will be illuminated with the sum
of the two luminous pencils. If we suppose those rays
to move in waves, and the elevation of the wave to
represent the maximum of luminous effect, then the
two waves meeting, when they are both at the height of
their undulation, will necessarily produce a spot of
greater intensity. If now we so arrange the points of
radiation, that the systems of luminous waves proceed
irregularly, and that one arrives at the screen
half an undulation before the other, the one in
elevation falling into the depression of the other, a
mutual annihilation is the consequence. This fact,
paradoxical as it may appear, was broadly stated by
Grimaldi, in the description of his experiments on the
inflection of light, and has been observed by many
others. The vibratory hypothesis, seizing upon the
analogy presented by two systems of waves in water,
explains this plausibly, and many similar phenomena of
what is called the <i>interference of light</i>; but still upon
examination it does not appear that the explanation is
quite free from objection.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Another theory, not altogether new to us, it being indicated
in Mayer’s hypothesis of three primary colours
(1775), and to be found as a problem in some of the
Encyclopædias of the last century, has been put forth,
in a very original manner, by that master-mind of intellectual
Germany, Goethe; and from the very comprehensive
views which this poet-philosopher has taken of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
both animal and vegetable physiology (views which have
been adopted by some of the first naturalists of Europe),
we are bound to receive his theory of colours with every
respect and attention.</p>

<p>Goethe regards colour as the “thinning” of light;
for example, by obstructing a portion of white light, yellow
is produced; by reducing it still farther, red is supposed
to result; and by yet farther retarding the free
passage of the beam, we procure a blue colour, which is
the next remove from blackness, or the absence of
light. There is truth in this; it bears about it a simplicity
which will satisfy many minds; by it many of
the phenomena of colour may be explained: but it is
insufficient for any interpretation of several of those
laws to which the other theories do give us some insight.</p>

<p>Newton may have allowed himself to be misled by
the analogy presented between the seven rays of the
spectrum and the notes in an octave. The mystic
number, seven, may have clung like a fibre of the web
of superstition to the cloak of the great philosopher;
but the attack made by Goethe upon the Newtonian
philosophy betrays the melancholy fact of his being
diseased with the lamentable weakness of too many
exalted minds&mdash;an overweening self-esteem.</p>

<p>The polarization of light, as it has been unfortunately
called&mdash;unfortunately, as conveying an idea of determinate
and different points or poles, which only exists
in hypothetical analogy&mdash;presents to us a class of phenomena
which promise to unclose the mysterious doors
of the molecular constitution of bodies.</p>

<p>This remarkable condition, as produced by the reflection
of light from glass at a particular angle, was
first observed by Malus, in 1808,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> when amusing himself
by looking at the beams of the setting sun, reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
from the windows of the Luxembourg Palace through
a double refracting prism. He observed that when the
prism was in one position, the windows with their golden
rays were visible; but that turned round a quarter of a
circle from that position, the reflected rays disappeared
although the windows were still seen.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of double refraction was noticed, in
the first instance, by Erasmus <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Bartolin">Bartholin</span>, in Iceland-spar,
a crystal the primary form of which is a rhombohedron;
who perceived that the two images produced
by this body were not in the same physical conditions.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
It was also studied by Huyghens and Sir Isaac Newton,
and to our countryman we owe the singular idea that a
ray of light emerging from such a crystal has <i>sides</i>.
This breaking up of the beam of light into two,&mdash;which
is shown by looking through a pin-hole on a card
through a crystal of Iceland spar, when two holes become
visible, is due to the different states of tension in
which the different layers constituting the crystal exist.</p>

<p>In thus separating the ray of light into two rays, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
condition called polarisation has been produced, and
by experiment we discover that the single ray has
properties different from those of the compound or
ordinary ray.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to explain what is meant by,
and what are the conditions of, <i>polarised light</i>. In the
first instance let us see by what methods this peculiar
state may be brought about.</p>

<p>If we reflect a ray of light from the surface of any
body, fluid or solid, but not metallic, at an angle between
53° and 68° it undergoes what has been called <i>plane
polarisation</i>. It may also be produced by the refraction
of light from several refracting surfaces acting upon the
pencil of light in succession; as by a bundle of plates
of glass. Each surface polarises a portion of the pencil,
and the number of plates necessary to polarise a whole
beam depends upon the intensity of the beam and the
angle of incidence. Thus, the light of a wax candle is
wholly polarised by forty-seven plates of glass at an
angle of 40° 41'; while at an angle of 79° 11' it is
polarised by eight plates. Again, plane polarisation
may be produced by the double refraction of crystals.
Each of the two pencils is polarised, like light reflected
from glass at an angle of 56° 45', but in opposite
planes.</p>

<p>Non-scientific readers will still ask,&mdash;What is this
mysterious condition of light which is produced by reflection
and refraction at peculiar angles to the incident
ray. It is one of the most difficult of problems to
express in popular language. The conditions are,
however, these:&mdash;</p>

<p>An ordinary ray of light will be reflected from a reflecting
surface at whatever angle that surface may be
placed in relation to the incident beam.</p>

<p>A polarised ray of light is not reflected in all positions
of the reflecting surface.</p>

<p>An ordinary ray of light is freely transmitted through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
a transparent medium, as glass, in whatever position it
may be placed relative to the source of light.</p>

<p>A polarised ray of light is not transmitted in all the
positions of the permeable medium.</p>

<p>Supposing a plate of glass is presented at the angle
56° to a polarised ray, and the plane of incidence or
reflexion is at right angles to the plane of polarisation
of the ray, <i>no light is reflected</i>. If we turn the plate of
glass round through 90°, when the plane of reflexion is
parallel to that of polarisation <i>the light is reflected</i>. If
we turn the plate round another 90°, so that the plane
of reflexion and of polarisation are parallel to each other,
again <i>no light is reflected</i>; and if we turn it through
another 90° the reflection of the ray again takes place.</p>

<p>Precisely the same result takes place when, instead of
being reflected, the polarised ray is transmitted.</p>

<p>Some substances have peculiar polarizing powers:
<i>the tourmaline</i> is a familiar example. If a slice of
tourmaline is taken, and we look at a common pencil
of light through it, we see it in whatever position we
may place the transparent medium. If, however, we
look at a pencil of polarised light, and turn the crystal
round, it will be found that in two positions the light is
stopped, and that in two other positions it passes freely
through it to the eye.</p>

<p>By way of endeavouring to conceive something of
what may be the conditions which determine this very
mysterious state, let us suppose each ray of light to
vibrate in two planes at right angles to each other: one
wave being vertical and the other horizontal. We have
many examples of this compound motion. The mast of
a ship, by the force with which she is urged through
the water, describes a vertical wave, while by the roll of
the billows across which she sails, a lateral undulation
is produced at the same time. We may sometimes
observe the same thing when a field of corn is agitated
by a shifting wind on a gusty day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>The hypothesis therefore is, that every ray of ordinary
light consists of two rays vibrating in different
planes; and that these rays, separated one from the
other, have the physical conditions which we call
<i>polarized</i>.</p>

<p>The most transparent bodies may be regarded as
being made up of atoms arranged in certain planes.
Suppose the plane of lamination of any substance to be
vertical in position, it would appear that the ray which
has a vertical motion passes it freely, whereas if we
turn the body round so that the planes of lamination
are at right angles to the plane of vibration of the ray,
it cannot pass.</p>

<p>That some action similar to that which it is here
endeavoured to express in popular language does take
place, is proved by the correctness of the results deduced
by rigid mathematical analyses founded on this hypothesis.</p>

<p>There are two other conditions of the polarization of
light&mdash;called <i>circular</i> and <i>elliptical</i> polarization. The
first is produced by light when it is twice reflected from
the second surface of bodies at their angle of maximum
polarization, and the second by reflexions from the surfaces
of metals at angles varying from 70° 45' to 78° 30'.
The motion of the wave in the first is supposed to be
circular, or to be that which is represented by looking
along the centre of a corkscrew as it is turned round.
At every turn of the medium effecting <i>circular polarization</i>
the colour of the ray of light is changed after a
uniform order. If turned in one direction, they change
through red, orange, yellow, green, and violet; and if
in the other direction, the colours appear in the contrary
order.</p>

<p>The variety of striking effects produced by the polarization
of light; the unexpected results which have
sprung from the investigation of the laws by which it
is regulated; and the singular beauty of many of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
phenomena, have made it one of the most attractive
subjects of modern science.</p>

<p>Ordinary light passes through transparent bodies
without producing any very striking effects in its passage;
but this <i>extraordinary</i> beam of light has the
power of insinuating itself between the molecules of
bodies, and by illuminating them, and giving them every
variety of prismatic hue, of enabling the eye to detect
something of the structure of the mass. The chromatic
phenomena of polarized light are so striking, that no
description can convey an adequate idea of their character.</p>

<p>Spectra more beautiful and intense than the prismatic
image,&mdash;systems of rings far excelling those of
thin plates,&mdash;and forms of the most symmetric order, are
constantly presenting themselves, as the polarized ray is
passed through various transparent substances; the
path of the ray indicating whether the crystal has been
formed round a single nucleus or axis, or whether it
has been produced by aggregation around two axes. The
coloured rings, and the dark or luminous crosses which
distinguish the path of the polarized ray, are respectively
due to different states of tension amongst the particles,
although those differences are so slight, that no other
means is of sufficient delicacy to detect the variation.</p>

<p>The poetry which surrounds these, in every way, mysterious
conditions of the solar beam, is such, that it is with
difficulty that imagination is restrained by the stern
features of truth. The uses of this peculiar property in
great natural phenomena are not yet made known to
us; but, since we find on every side of us the natural
conditions for thus separating the beam of light, and
effecting its polarization, there must certainly be some
most important end for which it is designed by Him
who said, “Let there be Light.”</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that we have at command
the means of showing that the chromatic phenomena of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
polarized light are due to atomic arrangement. By
altering the molecular arrangement of transparent bodies,
either by heat or by mere mechanical pressure, the unequal
tension or strain of the particles is at once indicated
by means of the polarized ray of light and its
rings of colour. Differences in the chemical constitution
of bodies, too slight to be discovered by any other
mode of analysis, can be most readily and certainly
detected by this luminous investigator of the molecular
forces.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Although we cannot enter into an examination of all
the conditions involved in the polarization of, and the
action of matter on, ordinary light, it will be readily conceived,
from what has <span class="correction" title="In the original book: beeen">been</span> already stated, that some
most important properties are indicated, beyond those
which science has made known.</p>

<p>Almost every substance in nature, in some definite
position, appears to have the power of producing this
change upon the solar ray, as may be satisfactorily shown
by examining them with a polarizing apparatus.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The
sky at all times furnishes polarized light, which is most
intense where it is blue and unclouded, and the point of
maximum polarization is varied according to the relative
position of the sun and the observer. A knowledge of
this fact has led to the construction of a “Solar Clock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
with which the hour can be readily determined by examining
the polarized condition of the sky. It has been stated,
that chemical change on the Daguerreotype plates and on
photographic papers is more readily produced by the
polarized than by the ordinary sunbeam.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> If this fact
be established by future investigations, we advance a
step towards the discovery so much desiderated of the
part it plays in natural operations.</p>

<p>The refined and accurate investigations of Dr. Faraday
stand prominently forward amid those which will
redeem the present age from the charge of being superficial,
and they will, through all time, be referred to as
illustrious examples of the influence of a love of truth
for truth’s sake, in entire independence of the marketable
value, which it has been unfortunately too much
the fashion to regard. The searching examination made
by this “interpreter of nature” into the phenomena of
electricity in all its forms, has led him onward to trace
what connexion, if any, existed between this great
natural agent and the luminous principle.</p>

<p>By employing that subtile analyzer, a polarized ray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
Dr. Faraday has been enabled to detect and exhibit
effects of a most startling character. He has proved
magnetism to have the power of influencing a ray of
light in its passage through transparent bodies. A
polarized ray is passed through a piece of glass or a
crystal, or along the length of a tube filled with some
transparent fluid, and the line of its path carefully
observed; if, when this is done, the solid or fluid body
is brought under powerful magnetic influence, such as
we have at command by making a very energetic voltaic
current circulate around a bar of soft iron, it will be
found that the polarized light is disturbed; that, indeed, it
does not permeate the medium along the same line.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
This effect is most strikingly shown in bodies of the
greatest density, and diminished in fluids, the particles
of which are easily moveable over each other, and has
not hitherto been observed in any gaseous medium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
The question, therefore, arises,&mdash;does magnetism act
directly upon the ray of light, or only indirectly, by producing
a molecular change in the body through which
the ray is passing? This question, so important in its
bearings upon the connexion between the great physical
powers, will, no doubt, before long receive a satisfactory
reply. A medium is necessary to the production of the
result, and, as the density of the medium increases, the
effect is enlarged: it would therefore appear to be due
to a disturbance by magnetic force of the particles
which constitute the medium employed.</p>

<p>Without any desire to generalize too hastily, we cannot
but express a feeling,&mdash;amounting to a certainty in
our own mind,&mdash;that those manifestations of luminous
power, connected with the phenomena of terrestrial
magnetism, which are so evident in all the circumstances
attendant upon the exhibition of Aurora Borealis,
and those luminous clouds which are often seen,
independent of the Northern Lights, that a very intimate,
relation exists between the solar radiations and
that power which so strangely gives polarity to this
globe of ours.</p>

<p>In connexion with the mysterious subject of solar
light, it is important that we should occupy a brief
space in these pages with the phenomena of vision, which
is so directly dependent upon luminous radiation.</p>

<p>The human eye has been rightly called the “masterpiece
of divine mechanism;” its structure is complicated,
yet all the adjustments of its parts are as simple as
they are perfect. The eye-ball consists of four coats.
The cornea is the transparent coat in front of the
globe; it is the first optical surface, and this is attached
to the sclerotic membrane, filling up the circular aperture
in the white of the eye; the choroid coat is a very
delicate membrane, lining the sclerotic, and covered
with a perfectly black pigment on the inside; and close
to this lies the most delicately reticulated membrane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
the retina, which is, indeed, an extension of the optic
nerve. These coats enclose three humours,&mdash;the aqueous,
the vitreous, and the crystalline humours.</p>

<p>The eye, in its more superficial mechanical arrangements,
presents exactly the same character as a camera
obscura, the cornea and crystalline lens receiving the
images of objects refracting and inverting them; but
how infinitely more beautiful are all the arrangements of
the organ of vision than the dark chamber of Baptista
Porta!<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The humours of the eye are for the purpose
of correcting the aberrations of light, which are so
evident in ordinary lenses, and for giving to the whole
an achromatic character. Both spherical and chromatic
aberration are corrected, the latter not entirely, and by
the agency of the cornea and the crystalline lens perfect
images are depicted on the retina, in a similar way to
those very charming pictures which present themselves
in the table of the camera obscura.</p>

<p>The seat of vision has been generally supposed to be
the retina; but Mariotte has shown that the base of the
optic nerve, which is immediately connected with the
retina, is incapable of conveying an impression to the
brain. The choroid coat, which lies immediately behind
the retina, is regarded by Mariotte and Bernoulli as the
more probable seat of vision. The retina, being transparent,
offers no obstruction to the passage of the light
onward to the black surface of the choroid coat, from
which the vibrations are, in all probability, communicated
to the retina and conveyed to the brain. Howbeit, upon
one or the other of these delicate coats a distinct image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
is impressed by light, and the communication made
with the brain possibly by a vibratory action. We may
trace up the phenomena of vision to this point; we may
conceive undulations of light, differing in velocity and
length of wave, occasioning corresponding tremors in
the neuralgic system of the eye; but how these vibrations
are to communicate correct impressions of length,
breadth, and thickness, no one has yet undertaken to
explain.</p>

<p>It has, however, been justly said by Herschel:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is the boast of science to have been able to trace
so far the refined contrivances of this most admirable
organ, not its shame to find something still concealed
from scrutiny; for, however anatomists may differ on
points of structure, or physiologists dispute on modes of
action, there is that in what we <i>do</i> understand of the
formation of the eye, so similar, and yet so infinitely
superior to a product of human ingenuity; such thought,
such care, such refinement, such advantage taken of the
properties of natural agents used as mere instruments
for accomplishing a given end, as force upon us a conviction
of deliberate choice and premeditated design,
more strongly, perhaps, than any single contrivance to
be found whether in art or nature, and renders its study
an object of the greatest interest.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Has the reader ever asked himself why it is, having
two eyes, and consequently two pictures produced upon
the tablets of vision, that we see only one object? According
to the law of visible direction, all the rays passing
through the crystalline lenses converge to one point
upon the retina,&mdash;and as the two images are coincident
and nearly identical, they can only produce the sensation
of one upon the brain.</p>

<p>When we look at any round object, as the ornamented
moderator lamp before us, first with one eye, and then
with the other, we discover that, with the right eye, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
see most of the right-hand side of the lamp, and with the
left eye more of the left-hand side. These two images
are combined, and we see an object which we know to
be round.</p>

<p>This is illustrated in a most interesting manner by
the little optical instrument, <i>the Stereoscope</i>. It consists
either of two mirrors placed each at an angle of 45°, or
of two semi-lenses turned with their curved sides towards
each other. To view its phenomena, two pictures are
obtained by the camera obscura on photographic paper
of any object in two positions, corresponding with the
conditions of viewing it with the two eyes. By the
mirrors or the lenses these dissimilar pictures are combined
within the eye, and the vision of an actually solid
object is produced from the pictures represented on a
plane surface. Hence the name of the instrument;
which signifies, <i>Solid I see</i>.</p>

<p>Analogy is often of great value in indicating the
direction in which to seek for a truth; but analogical
evidence, unless where the resemblance is very striking,
should be received with caution. Mankind are so ready
to leap to conclusions without the labour necessary for
a faithful elucidation of the truth, that too often a few
points of resemblance are seized upon, and an inference
is drawn which is calculated to mislead.</p>

<p>There is an idea that the phenomena of sound bear a
relation to those of light,&mdash;that there exists a resemblance
between the chromatic and the diatonic scales.
Sound, we know, is conveyed by the beating of material
particles&mdash;the air&mdash;upon the auditory membrane of the
ear, which have been set in motion by some distant disturbance
of the medium through which it passes. Light
has been supposed to act on the optic nerve in the same
manner. If we imagine colour to be the result of vibrations
of different velocities and lengths, we can understand
that under some of these tremors, first established
on the nerves, and through them conveyed to the brain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
sensations of pain or pleasure may result, in the same
way as sharp or subdued sounds are disagreeable or
otherwise. Intensely coloured bodies do make an impression
upon perfectly blind men; and those who,
being born blind, know no condition of light or colour,
will point out a difference between strongly illuminated
red and yellow media. When the eyes are closed we
are sensible to luminous influence, and even to differences
of colour. We must consequently infer that light
produces some peculiar action upon the system of nerves
in general; this may or may not be independent of the
chemical agency of the solar radiations; but certainly
the excitement is not owing to any calorific influence.
The system of nerves in the eye is more delicately
organized, and of course peculiarly adapted to all the
necessities of vision.</p>

<p>Thus far some analogy does appear to exist between
light and sound; but the phenomena of the one are so
much more refined than those of the other&mdash;the
impressions being all of them of a far more complicated
character, that we must not be led too far by the analogical
evidence in referring light, like sound, to mere
material motion.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful idea that real impressions of external
objects are made upon the seat of vision, and that
they are viewed, as in a picture, by something behind
the screen,&mdash;that these pictures become dormant, but
are capable of being revived by the operations of the
mind in peculiar conditions; but we can only regard it
as a philosophical speculation of a poetic character, the
truth or falsehood of which we are never likely to be
enabled to establish.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span></p>
<p>That which sees will never itself be visible. The
secret principle of sensation,&mdash;the mystery of the life
that is in us,&mdash;will never be unfolded to finite minds.</p>

<p>Numerous experiments have been made from time to
time on the influence of light upon animal life. It has
been proved that the excitement of the solar rays is too
great for the healthful growth of young animals; but,
at the same time, it appears probable that the development
of the functional organs of animals requires, in
some way, the influence of the solar rays. This might,
indeed, have been inferred from the discovery that
animal life ceases in situations from which light is
absolutely excluded. The instance of the Proteus of the
Illyrian lakes may appear against this conclusion. This
remarkable creature is found in the deep and dark
recesses of the calcareous rocks of Adelsburg, at Sittich;
and it is stated, also in Sicily, and in the Mammoth caves
of Kentucky. Sir Humphry Davy describes the Proteus
anguinus as “an animal to whom the presence of light
is not essential, and who can live indifferently in air and
in water, on the surface of the rock, or in the depths of
the mud.” The geological character of rocks, however,
renders it extremely probable that these animals may
have descended with the water, percolating through
fissures from very near the surface of the ground. All
the facts with which science has made us acquainted&mdash;and
both natural and physical science has been labouring
with most untiring industry in the pursuit of truth&mdash;go
to prove that light is absolutely <span class="correction" title="In the original book: neccessary">necessary</span> to
organization. It is possible the influence of the solar
radiations may extend beyond the powers of the human
senses to detect luminous or thermic action, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
consequently a development of animal and vegetable
forms may occur where the human eye can detect no
light; and under such conditions the Proteus may be
produced in its cavernous abodes, and also those creatures
which live buried deep in mud. Some further consideration
of the probable agency of light will occupy us,
when we come to examine the phenomena of vital
forces.</p>

<p>Light is essentially necessary to vegetable life; and
to it science refers the powers which the plant possesses
of separating carbon from the air breathed by the
leaves, and secreting it within its tissues for the purpose
of adding to its woody structure. As, however,
we have, in the growing plant, the action of several
physical powers exerted to different ends at the same
time, the remarkable facts which connect themselves
with vegetable chemistry and physiology are deferred for
a separate examination.</p>

<p>The power of the solar rays to produce in bodies that
peculiar gleaming light which we call phosphorescence,
and the curious conditions under which this phenomenon
is sometimes apparent, independent of the sun’s
direct influence, present a very remarkable chapter in
the science of luminous powers.</p>

<p>The phosphorescence of animals is amongst the most
surprising of nature’s phenomena, and it is not the
less so from our almost entire ignorance of the cause of
it. Many very poetical fancies have been applied in
description of these luminous creations; and imagination
has found reason why they should be gifted with
these extraordinary powers. The glow-worm lights her
lamp to lure her lover to her bower, and the luminous
animalcules of the ocean are employed in lighting up
the fathomless depths where the sun’s rays cannot
penetrate, to aid its monsters in their search for prey.
“The lamp of love&mdash;the pharos&mdash;the telegraph of the
night,&mdash;which scintillates and marks, in the silence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
darkness, the spot appointed for the lover’s rendezvous,”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
is but a pretty fiction; for the glow-worm shines in its
infant state, in that of the larva, and when in its aurelian
condition. Of the dark depths of the ocean it may be
safely affirmed that no organized creation lives or
moves in its grave-like silence to require this fairy aid.
Fiction has frequently borrowed her creations from
science. In these cases science appears to have made
free with the rights of fiction.</p>

<p>The glow-worms (<i>lampyris noctiluca</i>), it is well known,
have the power of emitting from their bodies a beautiful
pale bluish-white light, shining during the hours of
night in the hedge-row, like crystal spheres. It appears,
from the observations of naturalists, that these insects
never exhibit their light without some motion of the
body or legs;&mdash;from this it would seem that the
phosphorescence was dependent upon nervous action,
regulated at pleasure by the insect; for they certainly
have the power of obscuring it entirely. If the glow-worm
is crushed, and the hands or face are rubbed with
it, luminous streaks, similar to those produced by
phosphorus, appear. They shine with greatly increased
brilliancy in oxygen gas and in nitrous oxide. From
these facts may we not infer that the process by which
this luminosity is produced, whatever it may be, has a
strong resemblance to that of respiration?</p>

<p>There are several varieties of flies, and three species of
beetles of the genus <i>Elater</i>, which have the power of
emitting luminous rays. The great lantern-fly of South
America is one of the most brilliant, a single insect
giving sufficient light to enable a person to read. In
Surinam a very numerous class of these insects are
found, which often illuminate the air in a remarkable
manner. In some of the bogs of Ireland a worm exists
which gives out a bright green light; and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
many other kinds of creatures which, under certain
circumstances, become luminous in the dark. This is
always dependent upon vitality; for all these animals,
when deprived of life, cease to shine.</p>

<p>At the same time we have many very curious
instances of phosphorescence in dead animal and
vegetable matter; the lobster among the Crustacea, and
the whiting among fishes, are striking examples;
decayed wood also emits much light under certain conditions
of the atmosphere. This development of light
does not appear to be at all dependent upon putrefaction;
indeed, as this process progresses, the luminosity
diminishes. We cannot but imagine that this light is
owing, in the first place, to direct absorption by, and
fixation within, the corpuscular structure of those bodies,
and that it is developed by the decomposition of the
particles under the influence of our oxygenous atmosphere.</p>

<p>The pale light emitted by phosphorus in the dark is
well known; and this is evidently only a species of slow
combustion, a combination of the phosphorus with the
oxygen of the air. Where there is no oxygen, phosphorus
will not shine; its combustion in chlorine or iodine
vapour is a phenomenon of a totally different character
from that which we are now considering. This phosphorescence
of animal and vegetable matter has been
regarded as something different from the slow combustion
of phosphorus; but, upon examination, all the
chemical conditions are found to be the same, and it is
certainly due to a similar chemical change.</p>

<p>The luminous matter of the dead whiting or the
mackerel may be separated by a solution of common
salt or of sulphate of magnesia; by concentrating these
solutions the light disappears; but it is again emitted
when the fluid is diluted. The entire subject is, however,
involved in the mystery of ignorance, although it
is a matter quite within the scope of any industrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
observer. The self-emitted light of the carbuncle of the
romancer is realized in these remarkable phenomena.</p>

<p>The phosphorescence of some plants and flowers is
not, perhaps, of the same order as that which belongs to
either of the conditions we have been considering. It
appears to be due rather to an absorption of light and
its subsequent liberation. If a nasturtium is plucked
during sunshine, and carried into a dark room, the eye,
after it has reposed for a short time, will discover the
flower by a light emitted from its leaves.</p>

<p>The following remarkable example, and an explanation
of it by the poet Goethe, is instructive:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the 19th of June, 1799, late in the evening,
when the twilight was deepening into a clear night, as I
was walking up and down the garden with a friend, we
very distinctly observed a flame-like appearance near
the oriental poppy, the flowers of which are remarkable
for their powerful red colour. We approached the place,
and looked attentively at the flowers, but could perceive
nothing further, till at last, by passing and repassing
repeatedly, while we looked side-ways on them, we succeeded
in renewing the appearance as often as we
pleased. It proved to be a physiological phenomenon,
and the apparent corruscation was nothing but the
spectrum of the flower in the complementary blue-green
colour. The twilight accounts for the eye being in a
perfect state of repose, and thus very susceptible, and
the colour of the poppy is sufficiently powerful in the
summer twilight of the longest days to act with full
effect, and produce a complementary image.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The leaves of the <i>œnothera macrocarpa</i> are said to
exhibit phosphoric light when the air is highly charged
with electricity. The agarics of the olive-grounds of
Montpelier have been observed to be luminous at night;
but they are said to exhibit no light, even in darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
<i>during the day</i>. The subterranean passages of the coal
mines near Dresden are illuminated by the phosphorescent
light of the <i>rhizomorpha phosphoreus</i>, a peculiar
fungus. On the leaves of the Pindoba palm, a species
of agaric grows which is exceedingly luminous at night;
and many varieties of the lichens, creeping along the
roofs of caverns, lend to them an air of enchantment by
the soft and clear light which they diffuse. In a small
cave near Penryn, a luminous moss is abundant; and it
is also found in the mines of Hesse. According to
Heinzmann, the <i>rhizomorpha subterranea</i> and <i>aidulæ</i>
are also phosphorescent.</p>

<p>It is but lately that a plant which abounds in the
jungles in the Madura district of the East Indies was
sent to this country, which, although dead, was
remarkably phosphorescent; and, when in the living
state, the light which it emitted was extraordinarily
vivid, illuminating the ground for some distance.
Those remarkable effects may be due, in some cases, to
the separation of phosphuretted hydrogen from decomposing
matter, and, in others, to some peculiar electric
manifestation.</p>

<p>The phosphorescence of the sea, or that condition
called by fishermen <i>brimy</i>, when the surface, being struck
by an oar, or the paddle-wheels of a steamer, gives out
large quantities of light, has been attributed to the presence
of myriads of minute insects which have the power
of emitting light when irritated. The night-shining
nereis (<i>Nereis noctiluca</i>) emits a light of great brilliancy,
as do several kinds of the mollusca. The nereides
attach themselves to the scales of fishes, and thus
frequently render them exceedingly luminous. Some
of the crustaceæ possess the same remarkable property;&mdash;twelve
different species of <i>cancer</i> were taken up by
the naturalists of the Zaire in the Gulf of Guinea.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The
<i>cancer fulgens</i>, discovered by Sir Joseph Banks, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
enabled to illuminate its whole body, and emits vivid
flashes of light. Many of the medusæ also exhibit
powerful phosphorescence.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> These noctilucous creatures
are, many of them, exceedingly minute, several thousands
being found in a tea-cup of sea water. They float
near the surface in countless myriads, and when disturbed
they give out brilliant scintillations, often leaving
a train of light behind them.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> By <span class="correction" title="In the original book: miscroscopic">microscopic</span> examination
no other fact has been elicited than that these
minute beings contain a fluid which, when squeezed out,
leaves a line of light upon the surface of water. The
appearance of these creatures is almost invariably on the
eve of some change of weather, which would lead us to
suppose that their luminous phenomena must be connected
with electrical excitation; and of this, the
investigations of Mr. C. Peach, of Fowey, communicated
to the British Association at Birmingham, furnish the
most satisfactory proofs we have as yet obtained.</p>

<p>Benvenuto Cellini <span class="correction" title="In the original book: give">gave</span> a curious account of a carbuncle
which shone with great brilliancy in the dark.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
The same thing has been stated of the diamond; but it
appears to be necessary to procure these emissions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
light, that the minerals should be first warmed <span class="correction" title="In the original book: near a a fire">near a
fire</span>. From this it may be <span class="correction" title="In the original book: infered">inferred</span> that the luminous
appearance is of a similar character to that of fluor
spar, and of numerous other earthy minerals, which,
when exposed to heat, phosphoresce with great brilliancy.
Phosphorescent glow can also be excited in similar
bodies by electricity, as was first pointed out by Father
Beccaria, and confirmed by Mr. Pearsall.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> These
effects, it must be remembered, are distinct from the
electric spark manifested upon breaking white sugar in
the dark, or scratching sulphuret of zinc.</p>

<p>In the instances adduced there is not necessarily any
exposure to the sunshine required. It is probable that
two, if not three, distinct phenomena are concerned in
the cases above quoted, and that all of them are distinct
from animal phosphorescence, or the luminous appearance
of vegetables. They, however, certainly prove,
either that light is capable of becoming latent, or that it
is only a condition of matter, in which it may be made
manifest by any disturbance of the molecular forces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
We have, in answer to this, very distinct evidence that
some bodies do derive this property from the solar rays.
Canton’s phosphorus, which is a sulphuret of calcium,
will, having been exposed to the sun, continue luminous
for some time after it is carried into the dark; as will
also the Bolognian stone,&mdash;a sulphuret of barium. This
result appears to be due to a particular class of the solar
rays; for it has been found, if these sulphurets, spread
smoothly on paper, are exposed to the influence of the
solar spectrum for some little time, and then examined
in the dark, that luminous spaces appear, exactly corresponding
with the most refrangible rays, or those
which excite chemical change; and one very remarkable
fact must not be forgotten&mdash;the dark rays of the spectrum
beyond the violet produce a lively phosphorescence,
which is <i>extinguished</i> by the action of the rays of least
refrangibility, or the heat rays&mdash;whilst artificial heat,
such as a warm iron, produces a very considerable
elevation of the phosphorescent effect.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It is not improbable,
that the fluorescent rays of Mr. Stokes may be
materially concerned in producing the phenomena of
phosphorescence: experiments are, however, required to
prove this.</p>

<p>In these allied phenomena we have effects which are
evidently dependent upon several dissimilar causes.
The phosphorescence of the living animal is due, without
doubt, to nervous excitation: that of the living
vegetable to solar luminous influence; and in the case
of the mosses of caverns, &amp;c. to the chemical agency of
the sun’s rays, which appears to be capable of conduction.
In the dead organic matter we have a purely
chemical action developing the light, and in the inor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>ganic
bodies we have peculiar molecular constitution, by
which an absorption of light appears to take place.</p>

<p>The subject is one of the greatest difficulty; the
torch of science is too dim to enable us to see the causes
at work in producing these marvellous effects. The
investigation leads, to a certain extent, to the elucidation
of many of the secrets of luminous action; and the
determination of the question, whether light is an
emanation from the sun, or only a subtile principle
diffused through all matter, which is excited by solar
influence, is intimately connected with the inquiry.</p>

<p>It has been stated that matter is necessary to the
development of light; that no luminous effect would be
produced if it were not for the presence of matter. Of
this we not only have no proof, but such evidence as we
have is against the position. There is no loss of light in
the most perfect vacuum we can produce by any artificial
means, which should be the case if matter was concerned
in the phenomena of light, as a cause.</p>

<p>Colour is certainly a property regulated by material
bodies; or rather, the presence of matter is necessary to
the production of colour. Chlorine gas is a pale yellow,
and nitrous vapour a yellowish red. These and one or
two other vapours, which are near the point of condensation
into fluids, are the only coloured gaseous or
vaporiform bodies. The sky is blue, because the
material particles of the atmosphere reflect back the
blue rays. But we have more practical illustrations
than this. The flame of hydrogen burning with oxygen
gives scarcely any light; allow it to impinge on lime, a
portion of which is carried off by the heat of the flame,
and the most intense artificial light with which we are
acquainted is produced. Hydrogen gas alone gives a
flame in which nearly all but the blue rays are wanting:
place a brush of steel or asbestos in it, and many of the
other rays are at once produced. An argand lamp, and
more particularly the lamp in which camphine&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
purified turpentine,&mdash;is burnt, gives a flame which emits
most of the rays found in sunlight. Spirit of wine
mixed with water, warmed and ignited, gives only yellow
rays; add nitrate of strontian and they become red; but
nitrate of barytes being mixed with the fluid, they are
changed to green and yellow; salts of copper afford fine
blue rays, and common salt intense yellow ones. Many
of these coloured rays and others can be produced in
great power by the use of various solid bodies introduced
into flame. This has not been sufficiently pointed out
by authors; but it is clear from experiments that light
requires the presence of matter to enable it to diffuse its
coloured glories. How is it that the oxygen and
hydrogen flame gives so little light, and with a solid
body present, pours forth such a flood of brilliancy?</p>

<p>The production of artificial light by electrical and
chemical agencies will necessarily find some consideration
under their respective heads. There are numerous
phenomena which connect themselves with luminous
power, or appear to do so, which, in the present state of
our knowledge, cannot come immediately under our
attention. We are compelled to reserve our limited
space for those branches of science which we are enabled
to connect with the great natural operations constantly
going on around us. Many of these more abstruse
results will, however, receive some incidental notice
when we come to examine the operation of the combined
physical forces on matter.</p>

<p>We see in light a principle which, if it has not its
source in the sun, is certainly dependent upon that
luminary for its manifestations and powers. From that
“fountain of light” we find this principle travelling to
us at a speed which almost approaches the quickness of
thought itself; yet by the refinements of science we
have been enabled to measure its velocity with the
utmost accuracy. The immortal poet of our own land
and language, in his creations of Ariel, that “tricksy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
spirit,” who could creep like music upon the waters, and
of the fantastic Puck, who could girdle the earth in
thirty minutes, appears to have approached to the
highest point to which mere imagination could carry the
human mind as to the powers of things ethereal.
Science has, since then, shown to man that this “spirit,
fine spirit,” was a laggard in his tasks, and a gross piece
of matter, when compared with the subtile essences
which man, like a nobler Prospero, has now subdued to
do him service.</p>

<p>Light is necessary to life; the world was a dead
chaos before its creation, and mute disorder would again
be the consequence of its annihilation. Every charm
which spreads itself over this rolling globe is directly
dependent upon luminous power. Colours, and probably,
forms, are the result of light; certainly the consequence
of solar radiations. We know much of the
mysterious influences of this great agent, but we know
nothing of the principle itself. The solar beam has
been tortured through prismatic glasses and natural
crystals; every chemical agent has been tried upon it,
every electrical force in the most excited state brought
to bear upon its operations, with a view to the discovery
of the most refined of earthly agencies; but it has passed
through every trial without revealing its secrets, and
even the effects which it produces in its path are unexplained
problems, still to tax the intellect of man.</p>

<p>Every animal and every plant alike proclaim that life
and health are due to light; and even the crystallizing
forms of inorganic matter, by bending towards it, confess
its all-prevailing sway. From the sun to each
planet revolving around that orb, and to the remotest
stars which gleam through the vast immensity of heaven,
we discover this power still in its brightness, giving
beauty and order to these unnumbered creations; no
less completely than to this small island of the universe
which we call our Earth. Through every form of matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
we can mark its power, and from all, we can, under certain
conditions, evoke it in lustre and activity. Over all
and through all light spreads its ethereal force, and manifests,
in all its operations, powers which might well exalt
the mind of Plato to the idea of an omniscient and omnipresent
God. Science, with her Ithuriel wand, has, however,
shown that light is itself the effect of a yet more
exalted cause, which we cannot reach.</p>

<p>Indeed, the attentive study of the fine abstractions of
science lifts the mind from the grossness of matter, step
by step, to the refinements of immateriality, and there
appear, shadowed out beyond the physical forces which
man can test and try, other powers still ascending, until
they reach the Source of every good and every perfect
gift.</p>

of those rays which issue from the central portion of the sun’s

and yet I confess myself somewhat at a loss what other cause to
assign for it. It must suffice, however, to have thrown out the
hint; remarking only, that I have other, and, I am disposed to
think, decisive evidence (which will find its place elsewhere) of the
existence of an absorptive solar atmosphere, extending beyond the
luminous one. The breadth of the border, I should observe, is
small, not exceeding 0·5 or 1/7 part of the sun’s radius, and this,
from the circumstances of the experiment, must necessarily err in
excess.”&mdash;Philosophical Transactions, 1840.</p></div>

on their distribution, considered as bearing on Geology.</i> By Edward
Forbes, F.R.S., &amp;c.&mdash;Reports of the British Association, vol. xii. Professor
Forbes remarks:&mdash;“A comparison of the testacea, and other
animals of the lowest zones, with those of the higher, exhibits a
very great distinction in the hues of the species, those of the
depths being, for the most part, white or colourless, while those of
the higher regions, in a great number of instances, exhibit brilliant
combinations of colour. The results of an enquiry into this subject
are as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“The majority of shells of the lowest zone are white or transparent;
if tinted rose is the hue, a very few exhibit markings of
another colour. In the seventh region, white species are also
very abundant, though by no means forming a proportion so great
as the eighth. Brownish red, the prevalent hue of the brachiopoda,
also gives a character of colour to the fauna of this zone;
the crustacea found in it are red. In the sixth zone the colours
become brighter, reds and yellows prevailing,&mdash;generally, however,
uniformly colouring the shell. In the fifth region many
species are banded or clouded with various combinations of colours,
and the number of white species has greatly diminished. In the
fourth, purple hues are frequent, and contrasts of colour common.
In the second and third, green and blue tints are met with, sometimes
very vivid; but the gayest combinations of colour are seen
in the littoral zone, as well as the most brilliant whites.
</p>
<p>
“The animals of Testacea, and the Radiata of the higher zones,
are much more brilliantly coloured than those of the lower, where
they are usually white, whatever the hue of the shell may be.
Thus the genus <i>Trochus</i> is an example of a group of forms mostly
presenting the most brilliant hues both of shell and animal; but
whilst the animals of such species as inhabit the littoral zone are
gaily chequered with many vivid hues, those of the greater depth,
though their shells are almost as brightly covered as the coverings
of their allies nearer the surface, have their animals, for the most
part, of a uniform yellow or reddish hue, or else entirely white.
The chief cause of this increase of intensity of colour as we ascend
is, doubtless, the increased amount of light above a certain depth.”&mdash;p.

paper entitled, <i>On a case of Superficial Colour presented, by a homogeneous

Bart, K.H., F.R.S., &amp;c.&mdash;<i>An epipolized beam of light</i> (meaning
thereby a beam which has once been transmitted through a quiniferous
solution, and undergone its dispersing action) <i>is incapable

experiment may be adduced,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
A glass jar being filled with a quiniferous solution, a piece of
plate glass was immersed in it vertically, so as to be entirely
covered, and to present one face directly to the incident light. In
this situation, when viewed by an eye almost perpendicularly over
it, so as to graze either surface very obliquely, neither the anterior
nor posterior face showed the slightest trace of epipolic colour.
Now, the light, at its egress from the immersed glass, entered the
liquid under precisely the same circumstances as that which, when
traversing the anterior surface of the glass jar, underwent epipolic
dispersion on first entering the liquid. It had, therefore, lost a
property which it originally possessed, and could not, therefore, be
considered <i>qualitatively</i> the same light.&mdash;Philosophical Transactions,

that when this was turned towards the south, the muriate of silver
exposed to the invisible rays which it reflected was darkened in
less than half an hour; whereas, when it was turned towards the
west, the muriate of silver exposed in the place where the rays
ought to have been reflected, was not darkened, although it was
left exposed for two hours. It is consequently to be presumed
that the chemical rays can undergo double refraction in traversing
certain diaphanous bodies; and lastly, we may say that they enjoy
the same physical properties as light in general.”&mdash;Philosophical

point of doubt referred to in the text.&mdash;“The magnetic forces do
not act on the ray of light directly and without the intervention of
matter, but through the mediation of the substance in which they
and the ray have a simultaneous existence; the substances and
the forces giving to and receiving from each other the power of
acting on the light. This is shown by the non-action of a vacuum,
of air or gases, and it is also further shown by the special degree
in which different matters possess the property. That magnetic
force acts upon the ray of light always with the same character of
manner, and in the same direction, independent of the different
varieties of substance, or their states of solid or liquid, or their
specific rotative force, shows that the magnetic force and the light
have a direct relation; but that substances are necessary, and that
these act in different degrees, shows that the magnetism and the
light act on each other through the intervention of the matter.
Recognising or perceiving <i>matter</i> only by its powers, and knowing
nothing of any imaginary nucleus abstract from the idea of these
powers, the phenomena described must strengthen my inclination

<p class="p2">Heat and light are derived from the sun, and we have
attempted to show, not only that the phenomena of
these two principles are different, but that they can
scarcely, in the present condition of our knowledge, be
regarded as modified manifestations of <i>one</i> superior
power. Associated with these two remarkable elements,
others may exist in the solar rays. Electrical phenomena
are certainly developed by both heat and light,
and peculiar electric changes are produced by exposure
to sunshine. Electricity may be merely <i>excited</i> by the
solar rays, or it may <i>flow</i> like light from the sun.
Chemical action may be only due to the disturbance of
some diffused principle; or it may be directly owing to
some agency which is radiated at once from the sun.</p>

<p>A sun ray is a magical thing: we connect it in our
fancy with the most ethereal of possible creations. Yet
in its action on matter it produces colour; it separates
the particles of solid masses farther from each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
and it breaks up some of the strongest forces of chemical
affinity. To modern science is entirely due the
knowledge we have gained of the marvellous powers of
the sunbeam; and it has rendered us familiar with
phenomena, to which the incantation scenes of the
Cornelius Agrippas of the dark ages were but ill-contrived
delusions, and their magic mirrors poor instruments.
The silver tablets of the photographic artist
receiving fixed impressions of the objects represented in
the dark chamber by a lens, are far superior as examples
of natural magic.</p>

<p>In the dark ages, or rather as the earliest gleams of
the bright morning of inductive research were dispelling
the mists of that phantom-peopled period, it was
observed, for the first time, that the sun’s rays turned a
white compound black. Man must have witnessed, long
before, that change which is constantly taking place in
all vegetable colours: some darkening by exposure to
sunlight, while others were bleached by its influence.
Yet those phenomena excited no attention, and the
world knew nothing of the mighty changes which were
constantly taking place around them. The alchemists&mdash;sublime
pictures of credulous humanity&mdash;toiling in
the smoke of their secret laboratories, waiting and
watching for every change which could be produced by
fire, or by their “royal waters,” caught the first faint
ray of an opening truth; and their wild fancy, that
light could change silver into gold, if they but succeeded
in getting its subtile beams to interpenetrate the metal,
was the clue afforded to the empirical philosopher to
guide him through a more than Cretan labyrinth.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span></p>
<p>The first fact recorded upon this, point was, that horn
silver blackened when exposed to the light. Without
doubt many anxious thoughts were given by these
alchemists to that fact. Here was, as it appeared, a
mixing up of light and matter, and behold the
striking change! It was a step towards the realization
of their dreams. Alas! poor visionaries! in pursuing
an ideality they lost the reality which was within their
grasp.</p>

<p>Truths come slowly upon man, and long it is before
these angel visits are acknowledged by humanity. The
world clings to its errors, and avoids the truth, lest its
light should betray their miserable follies.</p>

<p>At length a man of genius announced that “<i>No substance
can be exposed to the sun’s rays without undergoing
a chemical change</i>;” but his words fell idly upon the
ear. His friends looked upon his light-produced pictures
as singular; they preserved them in their cabinets of
curiosities; but the truths which he enunciated were
soon forgotten. Howbeit his words were recorded, and
it is due to the solitary experimentalist of Châlons on
the Saône, to couple the name of Niepce with the discovery
of a fact which is scarcely second to the development
of the great law of universal gravitation.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> But
an examination awaits us, which, for its novelty, has
more charms than most branches of science, and which,
for the extensive views it opens to the inquirer, has an
interest in nowise inferior to any other physical investigation.</p>

<p>The prismatic spectrum affords us the means of examining
the conditions of the solar rays with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
facility. In bending the ray of white light out of its
path, by means of a triangular piece of glass, we divide
it in a remarkable manner. We learn that heat is less
refracted by the glass than the other powers; we find
the maximum point of the calorific rays but slightly
thrown out of the right line, which the solar pencil would
have taken, had it not been interrupted by the prism;
and the thermic action is found to diminish with much
regularity on either side of this line. We discover that
the luminous power is subject to greater refraction, and
that its maximum lies considerably above that of heat;
and that, in like manner, on each side the light
diminishes, producing orange, red, and crimson colours
below the maximum point, and green, blue, and violet
above it. Again, we find that the radiations which
produce chemical change are more refrangible than
either of the others, and the maximum of this power is
found at the point where light rapidly diminishes, and
where scarcely any heat can be detected: it extends in
full activity, above its maximum, to a considerable distance,
where no trace of light under ordinary conditions
exists, and below that point, until light, appearing to
act as an interfering agent, quenches its peculiar properties.
These are strong evidences that <i>light</i> and
<i>actinism</i>&mdash;as this principle has been named&mdash;are not
identical: and we may separate them most easily and
effectually from each other. Certain glasses, stained
dark blue, with oxide of cobalt, admit scarcely any
light; but they offer no interruption to the passage of
actinism or the chemical rays; on the contrary, a pure
yellow glass, or a yellow fluid, which does not sensibly
reduce the intensity of any one colour of the chromatic
band of luminous rays, completely cuts off this chemical
principle, whatever it may be. In addition to these,
there are other results which we shall have to describe,
which prove that, although associated in the solar beam,
light and actinism are in constant antagonism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>When Daguerre first published his great discovery,
the European public regarded his metal tablets with
feelings of wonder: we have grown accustomed to the
beautiful phenomena of this art, and we have become
acquainted with a number of no less beautiful processes
on paper, all of which, if studied aright, must convince
the most superficial thinker, that a world of wonder lies
a little beyond our knowledge, but within the reach of
industrious and patient research. Photography is the
name by which the art of sun-painting will be for ever
known. We regard this as unfortunate, conveying as it
does a false idea,&mdash;the pictures not being <i>light-drawn</i>.
Could we adopt the name given by Niepce to the process,
the difficulty would be avoided, since Heliography
involves no hypothesis, and strictly tells the undeniable
truth, that our pictures are <i>sun-drawn</i>. That pictures
can be produced by the rays from artificial sources,
presents no objection to this; these rays were still
originally derived from the sun.</p>

<p>By whatever name we determine to convey our
ideas of these phenomena, it is certain that they involve
a series of effects which are of the highest interest to
every lover of nature, and of the utmost importance to
the artist and the amateur. By easy manipulation we
are now enabled to give permanence to the charming
pictures which are produced by means of that pleasing
invention of Baptista Porta, the <i>Camera Obscura</i>. Any
image, which being refracted by the lens of this instrument
falls upon the table in its dark chamber, may be
secured with its most delicate gradations of shadows,
upon either a metallic or a paper tablet.</p>

<p>But let us proceed to the examination of a few of the
more striking phenomena of these chemical changes.
To commence with some of the more simple but no less
important results.</p>

<p>Chlorine and hydrogen will not unite in darkness,
nor will chlorine and carbonic oxide; but, if either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
those gaseous mixtures is exposed to sunshine, they
combine rapidly, and often with explosion. A solution
of the sulphate of iron in ordinary water may be preserved
for a long time in the dark without undergoing
any change; expose it to the sunshine, and a precipitation
of oxide of iron is very rapidly produced. The
mineral chameleon, the <i>manganesiate of potash</i> in solution,
is almost instantly decomposed in daylight; but it
is a long time before it undergoes any change in darkness.
The same thing occurs with a combination of
platinum and lime: indeed, it appears that precipitation
is at all times, and under all circumstances,
accelerated by the solar rays. As these precipitations
are in exact agreement with the quantity of actinic
radiation to which the solutions have been exposed, we
may actually weigh off the relative quantities, representing
in grains the equivalent numbers to the amount of
actinism which has influenced the chemical compound.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span></p>
<p>We have evidence which appears to prove that this
chemical agent may be absorbed by simple bodies, and
that by this absorption an actual change of condition, is
produced, in many respects analogous to those allotropic
changes which we have previously considered. Chlorine,
in its ordinary state, does not combine with hydrogen in
the dark. If we employ the yellow medium of chlorine
gas, for the purpose of analyzing the sun’s rays previously
to their falling upon some chemical compound
which is sensitive to actinic power, we shall find that
the chlorine obstructs all this actinism, and, however
unstable the compound, it remains unchanged. But the
chlorine gas which has interrupted this wonderful agent,
appears to have absorbed it, and it is so far altered in its
constitution that <i>it will unite with hydrogen in the
dark</i>.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In like manner, if, of two portions of the same
solution of sulphate of iron, one is kept in the dark and
the other exposed to the sunshine, it will be found that
the solution which has been exposed will precipitate
gold and silver from their combinations much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
speedily than that which has been preserved in darkness&mdash;the
temperature and every other condition being the
same.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the Daguerreotype involve many
strange conditions. A plate of silver, on which a slight
chemical action has been established by the use of iodine,
is exposed to the lenticular image in the camera
obscura. If allowed to remain under the influence of
these radiations for a sufficient length of time, a faithful
picture of the illuminated objects is delineated on the
plate, as shown by the visible decomposition and darkening
of the iodized surface. The plate is not, however,
in practice allowed to assume this condition; after an
exposure of a few seconds the radiant influence is cut
off, and the eye cannot detect any evidence of change
upon the yellow plate. It is now exposed to the vapour
of mercury, and that metal in a state of exceedingly fine
division is condensed upon the plate; but the condensation
is not uniformly spread upon its face. The
deposit of mercurial vapour is in exact proportion to the
amount of chemical action produced. Is the change,
by which this peculiar power of condensation is effected,
a chemical, calorific, electrical, or merely a molecular
one? The evidences, at present, are not sufficient to
determine the question. It has lately been suggested,
that the mercury acts chemically only, and effects the
full decomposition of the iodide of silver; and that the
picture is due to this, and not to the deposition actually
of the mercury vapour. In all probability we have the
involved action of several forces. We have some experiments
which show, clearly enough, that mercury is
deposited in proportions which correspond with the
intensity of solar action. A chemically prepared surface
is not necessary to exhibit this result. A polished
plate of metal, of glass, of marble, or a piece of painted
wood, being partially exposed, will, when breathed upon,
or presented to the action of mercurial vapour, show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
that a disturbance has been produced upon the portions
which were illuminated, whereas no change can be
detected upon the parts which were kept in the dark.
It was thought, until lately, that a few chemical compounds,
such as the iodide of silver, the material employed
in the Daguerreotype and Calotype,&mdash;chloride of
silver, the ordinary photographic agent,&mdash;a few salts of
gold, and one or two of lead and iron, were the only
materials upon which these very remarkable changes
were produced. We now know that it is impossible to
expose any body, simple or compound, to the sun’s rays,
without its being influenced by this chemical and molecular
disturbing power. To take our examples from
inorganic nature, the granite rock which presents its
uplifted head in firmness to the driving storm, the stones
which genius has framed into forms of architectural
beauty, or the metal which is intended to commemorate
the great acts of man, and which in the human form
proclaims the hero’s deeds and the artist’s talent, are
all alike destructively acted upon during the hours of
sunshine, and, but for provisions of nature no less
wonderful, would soon perish under the delicate touch
of the most subtile of the agencies of the universe.</p>

<p>Niepce was the first to show that all bodies which
underwent this change during daylight possessed the
power of restoring themselves to their original conditions
during the hours of night, when this excitement
was no longer influencing them. Resins, the Daguerreotype
plate, the unprepared metal tablet, and numerous
photographic preparations, prove this in a remarkable
manner.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span></p>
<p>The picture which we receive to-day, unless we adopt
some method of securing its permanency, fades away
before the morrow, and we try to restore it in vain.
With some of our chemical preparations this is very
remarkably shown, but by none in so striking a manner
as by paper prepared with the iodide of platinum, which,
being impressed with an image by heliographic power,
which is represented by dark brown tints, restores itself
in the dark, in a few minutes, to its former state of a
yellow colour, and recovers its sensibility to sunshine.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
The inference we alone can draw from all the evidences
which the study of actino-chemistry affords, is, that the
hours of darkness are as necessary to the inorganic
creation as we know night and sleep to be to the organic
kingdom. But we must not forget that there does exist
in the solar rays a balance of forces which materially
modifies the amount of disturbing influence exerted by
them on matter. Not only do we find that the chemical
action is not extended over the whole length of the
prismatic spectrum, but we discover that over spaces,
which correspond with the maximum points of light and
heat, a protective action is exerted. That is, that
highly sensitive photographic agents, which blacken
rapidly under exposure to diffused daylight, are entirely
protected from change in full sunshine, if at the same
time as a strong light is thrown upon them by reflection,
the yellow and extra red rays are brought to bear upon
their surface. Not only so, but by employing media
which will cut off all the chemical rays of the spectrum,
admitting freely at the same time the luminous and
calorific rays, we find that a protected band, the length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
of the spectrum, remains white, whilst every other
portion has blackened.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Among the many curious instances of natural magic,
none are more remarkable than an experiment not long
since proposed, by which Daguerreotype pictures may
be taken in absolute darkness to the human eye. This
is effected in the following manner:&mdash;A large prismatic
spectrum is thrown upon a lens fitted into one side of a
dark chamber; and as we know that the actinic power
resides in great activity beyond the violet ray, where
there is no light, the only rays which we allow to pass
the lens into the chamber are those which are extra-spectral
and non-luminous. These are directed upon,
any white object, and from that object radiated upon a
highly sensitive plate in a camera obscura. Thus a
copy of the subject will be obtained by the agency of
radiations which produce no sensible effect upon the
optic nerve. This experiment is the converse of those
which show us that we may illuminate any object with
the strongest <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sun-light">sunlight</span> which has passed through
yellow glass, the yellow solution of sulphuret of calcium,
or of the bichromate of potash&mdash;these being non-transparent
to the chemical rays&mdash;and yet fail to
secure any Daguerreotype copy of it, even upon
the most exquisitely sensitive plate. Indeed, the
image of the sun itself, when setting through an
atmosphere which reduces its light to a red or rich
yellow colour, not only produces no chemical change,
but protects an iodized plate from it; and whilst every
other part of the tablet gives a picture of surrounding
objects in the ordinary character, the bright sun itself
is represented by a spot upon which no change has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
taken place.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In tropical climes, where a brilliant sun
is giving the utmost degree of illumination to all surrounding
objects, all photographic preparations are
acted upon relatively more slowly than in the climate of
England, where the light is less intense. As a remarkable
instance of this fact, a circumstance may be
mentioned, which is curiously illustrative of the power
of light to interfere with actinism:&mdash;</p>

<p>A gentleman, well acquainted with the Daguerreotype
process, obtained in the city of Mexico all the
necessary apparatus and chemicals, expecting, under the
bright light and cloudless skies of that climate, to produce
pictures of superior excellence. Failure upon
failure was the result; and although every care was
used, and every precaution adopted, it was not until the
rainy season set in that he could secure a good Daguerreotype
of any of the buildings of that southern city.</p>

<p>The first attempts, which were made at the instigation
of M. Arago, by order of the French Government, to
copy the Egyptian tombs and temples, and the remains
of the Aztecs in Central America, were failures.
Although the photographers employed succeeded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
admiration in Paris, in producing pictures in a few
minutes, they found often that an exposure of an hour
was insufficient under the bright and glowing illumination
of a southern sky.</p>

<p>Experiments with the spectrum have been made in
different latitudes, and it is found, that, as we proceed
towards the equator, a band which is always left
unchanged, corresponding exactly with the rays of
greatest illuminating power, regularly enlarges in size,
thus proving the increase of light over actinism&mdash;and
the interfering power of the former.</p>

<p>By increasing the sensibility of the photographic preparation,
this difficulty is overcome, and particularly
when any organic compound enters into the preparation.
So that we are now enabled to copy nature in all her
varying moods, whether we employ our photographic
tablets in temperate Europe, or in tropical Africa.</p>

<p>The degree of sensibility which has been attained is
remarkable. Mr. Fox Talbot, by uniting a process
devised by Dr. Woods, of Parsonstown, and another
which was first introduced by the author of this volume,
and combining them with an ether, obtains a most
unstable compound, which he thus employs. A glass
plate is covered with albumen united with the above
solution, and then with nitrate of silver: this forms the
sensitive surface. The plate being placed in the dark,
in a camera, it is so adjusted that the image of a
printed bill fixed upon a wheel may fall upon it when
uncovered, and the wheel illuminated. The wheel is
made to revolve with the utmost rapidity, in a perfectly
dark room, and the sensitive plate uncovered. Then
the whirling bill is illuminated for an inappreciably short
space of time by the discharge of a Leyden jar.
Notwithstanding the rapid rate at which the pointed
paper is moving, and the instantaneous nature of the
illumination&mdash;a miniature flash of lightning&mdash;the bill is
found to be copied with unfailing fidelity upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
photographic plate. It unfortunately happens, that the
preparation by which this extraordinary degree of
sensibility is obtained, is very uncertain in its action&mdash;and
hence it is not generally useful; but here we have
the evidence to show that at a speed as rapid as that of
a rifle-ball an impression may be made upon a photographic
plate. There are, however, some new processes
which promise eventually to rival the above for sensibility,
and to be by no means of difficult manipulation.
Of this character is the collodion process. The
gun cotton dissolved in ether possesses some very great
accelerating properties, and in combination with the
silver salts, and one of the vegetable acids, it forms a
sensitive surface upon which pictures may be obtained
in less than a second of time.</p>

<p>Colour, natural colour too, has been very decidedly
secured. The sun has been solicited to display his
palette, and the answer has been a picture in which
colour for colour in all their fidelity have been impressed.
The plate upon which this result has been obtained is
of a dark brown colour, and the chromatic variety is, as
it were, eaten out by the solar rays. These colours
have not yet been permanently fixed upon the plate
employed, but from the temporary degree of fixedness
which has been obtained, we may fairly hope that in a
short time colour may be rendered as permanent on the
productions of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: photograper">photographer</span> as on those of the
painter. It is a curious and striking fact, that in the
preparation of these plates, salts are used which give
colours to flame; and according to the colour which
is produced by them when burning, so, on the photographic
plate, is that colour impressed with greater
intensity than the others. To what is this leading us?
Mysteries surround our advances on the domain of
truth. We dare not speculate upon them: the time of
their full development will arrive.</p>

<p>By the aid of this beautiful art, we are enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
preserve the lineaments of those who have <span class="correction" title="In the original book: benefitted">benefited</span>
their race by their intellect, or their heroism. We can
hand down to future ages portraits of our own Wellington,
and the illustrious Arago, unerring in their truthfulness.
How great would be the joy of all, could we
now obtain a daguerreotype portrait of a Greek poet,
or of a Roman philosopher, of a Sophocles, or of a
Seneca! How much discussion would be prevented did
we possess a calotype portrait of the Bard of Avon, or of
the Philosopher of Grantham!</p>

<p>By the agency of those very rays which give life and
brilliancy to the laughing eye and the roseate cheek,
we can at once correctly trace the outline of the
features we admire, with all those shadowy details which
give a reality to the “presentment.” The objects of
our love may be for ever present with us in these self-painted
pictures. The vicious, whom we would avoid,
may be made known to us by this unerring painter. The
process which nature employs is perfect; the imperfections
are those of man, and these being few, he may soon
learn to remedy.</p>

<p>To the traveller, how valuable are the processes
of photography! He secures representations of those
remains of temples which were in their glory when
Moses wrote. He copies by one operation a tomb at
Karnac, covered with myriads of hieroglyphics, or an
inscribed stone in Arabia, which it would occupy him
days to trace. These he can carry to his home and
read at his leisure. The relics of hoar antiquity speaking
to the present of the past, and recording the
histories of races which have fleeted away like shadows,
are thus preserved to tell their wondrous tales.</p>

<p>The admirer of nature may copy her arrangements
with the utmost fidelity. Every modulation of the
landscape, each projecting rock or beetling tor&mdash;the
sinuous river in its rapid flow&mdash;the meandering stream,
“gliding like happiness away;” and the spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
plains over which are scattered the homes of honest
industry and domestic peace, intermingled with the
towers of those humble temples in which simple-hearted
piety delights to “bow the head and bend their knee;”
these, all of these, may, by the sunbeam which illuminates
the whole, be faithfully pencilled upon our chemical
preparations.</p>

<p>Our art enables us to do more even than this; we
have but to present our sensitive tablet to the moon,
and she, by her own light, prints her mountains and her
valleys, and indicates with all truth the physical conditions
of her surface.</p>

<p>Any reference to the <i>chemical agency</i> of <span class="smcap">light</span>&mdash;<i>the
luminous rays</i> as distinguished from the <i>chemical
and calorific rays</i>&mdash;has been avoided until we came to
the consideration of this particular question of chemical
change.</p>

<p>Upon organic compounds, as, for instance, upon the
colouring matter of leaves and flowers, <i>light</i> does exert
a chemical power: and it is found that vegetable
colours are bleached, not by rays of their own colour,
but by those which are <i>complementary</i> to them. A red
dye fades under the influence of a green ray, and a
yellow under that of a violet one, much more speedily
than when exposed to rays of any other colour; and this,
it must be remembered, is due to the coloured ray
itself, and not to any <i>actinic</i> power masked, as it were,
behind the colour, as is generally believed.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
long a question whether the decomposition of carbonic
acid by plants was due to the luminous or the chemical
rays. It is now clearly established that the luminous
rays are the most active in producing this effect; which
they do indirectly, by exciting the vital powers of the
organized structures. Therefore we would refer this
phenomenon of gaseous decomposition to a vital power
quickened by luminous excitement.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>We have already noticed some chemical phenomena
due to heat, particularly those experiments of Count
Rumford’s, which appeared to him to prove that the
chemical agency of the sun’s rays was due to its calorific
power. Certain chemical phenomena, we know, may be
produced by thermic action; but the only variety of
thermo-chemical action which connects itself immediately
with the solar radiations, belongs to a class of
rays to which the name of <i>Parathermic</i> has been given,
and to which the scorching, as it is called, of plants, the
browning of the autumnal leaves, and the ripening of
fruits, appear to be due.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> When we come to the consideration
of those physical phenomena which belong to
the growth of plants, all these peculiarities of solar
action must be attended to in detail.</p>

<p>The manner in which we find the actinic power
influencing electrical action, also shows us that the
equilibrium of forces is continued through all the great
principles of nature. If a galvanic arrangement is made,
by which small quantities of metals may be slowly precipitated
at one of the poles in the dark, and a similar
arrangement be exposed to sunshine, it will be found
that no metal is deposited: the sun’s rays have interfered
with the decomposing power of the electrical
current. At the same time we learn, that by throwing
a beam of light upon a plate of copper which forms one
of a galvanic pair, whilst it is under the influence of an
acidulated solution, an additional excitation takes place,
and the galvanometer will indicate the passage of an
increased current of electricity. These two dissimilar
actions appear enigmatical; but they may, there is no
doubt, receive some solution from the influence of
different rays on the contrary poles of the battery. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
thing is quite evident,&mdash;electricity suffers a disturbance
of one order, by light; and an excitement of another by
its associated principles in the sunbeam. If a yellow
glass is interposed between the galvanic arrangement
and the sun, the electro-chemical precipitation goes on
in the same manner as it would in perfect darkness,
and no extra excitement is produced upon the plates of
the battery. From this it would appear that actinism
and not light is to be regarded as the disturbing power.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
It has already been shown that yellow media possess the
power of stopping back the chemical agent.</p>

<p>We have already, detailed many of the peculiarities of
the different varieties of Phosphori, which would seem
to be the result of light. Phosphorescence is probably
excited by those rays which produce no direct effect
upon the eye. If we spread sulphuret of calcium upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
paper, and expose it to the action of the solar spectrum,
it is found to glow (in the dark) only over those spaces
occupied by the violet rays and the ordinarily dark rays
beyond them; proving that the excitation necessary to
the development of the phenomena of phosphorescence
is due to a class of rays distinct from the true light-giving
principle, and more nearly allied to that principle
or power which sets up chemical decomposition.
Whether the fluorescent rays, before mentioned, which
are found so abundantly over the space which produces
the greatest phosphorescent effect, are active in producing
the phenomena, is as yet an unsolved problem.</p>

<p>Vision and colour, calorific action, chemical change,
molecular disturbance, electrical phenomena, and phosphorescent
excitation, all, each one with a strange
duality, are connected with the sunbeam.</p>

<p>We find, when we receive solar spectra upon iodized
plates, or on several kinds of photographic paper, that a
line, over which no action takes <span class="correction" title="In the original book: plates">place</span>, is preserved at
the top and bottom of the impressed image, and in many
cases along the sides also. The only way in which this
can be accounted for, as the spectrum represents the
sun in a distorted form, is by supposing that rays come
from the edges of the sun of a different character from
those which proceed from the centre of that orb.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Light from the centre of the solar disc is under different
conditions from that which comes from the edge
of the sun: this is due to the varying angle, which is
presented to us by a circular body: calorific action seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
to be more strongly manifested when the envelope of
light, extending like an atmosphere to the sun, is thrown
into great agitation, and waves, and great hollows&mdash;solar
spots&mdash;are produced. There is some indication of
the existence of a third condition on the sun’s surface,
to which probably belongs the mighty chemical power
which we call actinism. Electricity may be, as some
have speculated, the exciting agent; a constant and
violent Aurora Borealis may exist on the sun, and
under the excitation of this force the others named may
be quickened into full activity.</p>

<p>That actinism is one of the great powers of creation
we have abundant proof. Nearly all the phenomena of
chemical change which have been referred to light, are
now proved to be dependent upon actinic power; and
beyond the influence which has been ascertained to be
exerted by it upon all inorganic bodies, we shall have
occasion to show still further the dependence of the
vegetable and animal worlds upon its agency. The influence
of the solar beams on vegetation is proved by
common experience; the closer examination of its
action on vegetable life is reserved for the chapter devoted
to its phenomena. Of its influence on animals
nothing is very correctly known; but some early experiments
prove that they, like other organised bodies, are
subject to all the radiant forces, as indeed, independent
of experiment, every observation must teach. Certain
it is, that organisation can take place only where
the sun’s rays can penetrate: where there is unchanging
darkness, there we find all the silence of death. Prometheus
stole fire from heaven, and gave the sacred gift
to man, as the most useful to him of all things in his
necessities: by the aid of it he could temper the severities
of climate, render his food more digestible and
agreeable, and illuminate the hours of darkness. So
says the beautiful fiction of the Grecian mind,&mdash;which
appears as the poetic dream or prophetic glance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>
gifted race, who felt the mysterious truth they were yet
unable to describe. Pheaton and Apollo are only other
foreshadowings of the creative energies which dwell in
the glorious centre of our universe. The poetry of the
Hellenic people ascended above the littlenesses of merely
human action, and sought to interpret the great truths
of creation. Reflective, they could not but see that
some mysterious powers were at work around them;
imaginative, they gave to fine idealisations the government
of those inexplicable phenomena. Modern science
has shown what vastly important offices the solar rays
execute, and that the principles discovered in a sunbeam
are indeed the exciters of organic life, and the disposers
of inorganic form.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that we have already
alluded to a speculation which supposes this actinic influence
to be diffused through all nature, to be indeed
the element to which chemical force in all its forms is to
be referred, and that it is merely excited by the solar
rays. This hypothesis receives some support from the
very peculiar manner in which chemical action once set
up is carried on, independent of all extraneous excitement,
after the first disturbance has been produced. If
any of the salts of gold are exposed in connection with
organic matter, as on paper, to sunshine for a moment,
an action is begun, which goes on unceasingly in the
dark, until the gold is reduced to its most simple state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
The same thing occurs with chromate of silver, some
of the salts of mercury, argentine preparations combined
with protosulphate of iron or gallic acid, and some other
chemical combinations. These progressive influences
point to some law not yet discovered, which seems to
link this radiant actinism with the chemical agent existing
in all matter.</p>

<p>This problem also connects itself with another class of
facts which, although due, in all probability, to a great
extent, to calorific radiations, and hence known under
the general term of Thermography, appear to involve
both chemical and electrical excitation. From the investigations
of Moser and of others, we learn the very
extraordinary fact, that even inanimate masses act and
react upon each other by the influence of some dark
radiations, and seem to exchange some of the peculiarities
which they possess. This appears generally in the
curious experiments which have been referred to, as confined
merely to form or structure. Thus an engraved
plate will give to a polished surface of metal or glass
placed near it, after a very little time, a neat distinct
image of itself; that is, produce such a structural disturbance
as will occasion the plate to receive vapour differently
over those spaces opposite to the parts in cameo
or in intaglio, from what it does over the opposite. If a
piece of wood is used instead of a <span class="correction" title="In the original book: medal">metal</span>, there will, by
similar treatment, be produced a true picture of the wood,
even to the representation of its fibres.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span></p>
<p>It is also probable that chemical decomposition is produced
by the mere juxtaposition of different bodies.
Iodide of gold or silver, perfectly pure, has been placed
upon a plate of glass, and a plate of copper covered with
mercury suspended over it: a gradual decomposition
of those salts is said to have been observed, iodide of
mercury to be formed, and the gold or silver salts reduced
to a finely divided metallic state.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>A body whose powers of radiating heat are low, being
brought near another whose radiating powers are more
extensive, will, in the course of a short time, undergo
such an amount of molecular disturbance as will effect
a complete change in the arrangement of its surface,
and an impression of the body having the highest radiating
powers will be made upon the other. This impression
is dormant, but may be developed under the
influence of vapour, or of oxidation.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> A body, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
charcoal, of low conducting power, being placed near
another, such as copper, which is a good conductor, will,
in a very short time, produce, in like manner, an impression
of itself upon the metal plate. Thus any two
bodies, whose conducting or radiating powers are dissimilar,
being brought near each other, will occasion a
molecular disturbance, or impress the one with the image
of the other. However small the difference may be, an
effect is perceived, and that of the most extraordinary
kind, giving rise to the production of actual images upon
each surface exposed. It is thus that a print on paper
may be copied on metal, by merely suspending it near a
well-polished plate of silver or copper for a few days.
The white and black lines radiate very differently; consequently
an effect is produced on the bright metal in
the parts corresponding to the black lines, dissimilar to
that which takes place opposite to the white portions
of the paper; and, on the application of vapour, a
true image of the one is found impressed upon the
other.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Bodies which are in different electrical states act upon
each other in an analogous manner. Thus arsenic, which
is highly electro-negative, will, when placed near a piece
of electro-positive copper, readily impart to its surface
an impression of itself, and so in like manner will other
bodies if in unlike conditions. Every substance physically
different (it signifies not whether as it regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
colour, chemical composition, mechanical structure, calorific
condition, or electrical state,) has a power of radiation
by which a sensible change can be produced in a
body differently constituted.</p>

<p>Fable has told us that the magicians of the East possessed
mirrors in which they could at will produce
images of the absent. Science now shows us that representations
quite sufficient to deceive the credulous can
be produced on the surface of polished metals without
difficulty. A highly polished plate of steel may be impressed
with images of any kind, which would remain
invisible, the polished surface not being in the least degree
affected, as it regards its reflecting powers; but by breathing
over it, the dormant images would develope themselves,
and fade away again as the condensed moisture
evaporated from the surface.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>These, which are but a few selected from a series of
results of an equally striking character, serve to convince
us that nature is unceasingly at work, that every
atom is possessed of properties by which it influences
every other atom in the universe, and that a most important
class of natural phenomena appear to connect
themselves directly with the radiant forces.</p>

<p>The alchemists observed that a change took place in
chloride of silver exposed to sunshine. Wedgwood first
took advantage of that discovery to copy pictures.
Niepce pursued a physical investigation of the curious
change, and found that all bodies were influenced by
this principle radiated from the sun. Daguerre produced
effects from the solar pencil which no artist could approach
to; and Talbot and others extended the applica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>tion.
Herschel took up the inquiry; and he, with his
usual power of inductive search and of philosophical
deduction, presented the world with a class of discoveries
which showed how vast a field of investigation was opening
for the younger races of mankind,&mdash;a field in which
a true spirit may reap the highest reward in the discovery
of new facts, and to which we must look for a further
development of those great powers with which we
have already some slight acquaintance, and for the discovery
of higher influences which are not yet dreamed
of in our philosophy.</p>

infinite number of bubbles of gas, which rise in the liquor with
increasing rapidity, and give the solution the appearance of a

becomes stronger, and almost tumultuous, when an unpolished

sun was of a deep red colour, I directed my apparatus towards it.
After ten seconds of exposure, I put the prepared plate in the
mercury box, and I obtained a round image perfectly black;&mdash;the
sun had produced no photogenic effect. In another experiment,
I left the plate operating for twenty minutes; the sun had passed
over a certain space of the plate, and there resulted an image seven
or eight times the sun’s diameter in length; it was black throughout,
so that it was evident, wherever the red disc of the sun had
passed, not only was there a want of photogenic action, but the
red rays had destroyed the effect produced previous to the sun’s
passage. I repeated these experiments during several days
successively, operating with a sun of different tints of red and
yellow. These different tints produced nearly the same effect;
wherever the sun had passed, there existed a black band.”&mdash;Mr.

a given tint are, in a great many cases, those whose union produces
a colour complementary to the tint destroyed, or at least one
belonging to that class of colours to which such complementary
tint may be referred. For example, yellows tending towards

the red, orange, and yellow rays; purples and pinks by yellow and

“My reply is this,” says M. Arago, in his paper entitled
<i>Considerations relative to the action of Light</i>: “It is by no means
proved that the photogenic modifications of sensitive substances
result from the action of the solar light itself. The modifications
are, perhaps, engendered by invisible radiations mixed with light
properly so called, proceeding with it, and being similarly refracted.
In this case, the experiment would prove not only that
the spectrum formed by these invisible rays is not continuous,
that there are solutions of continuity as in the visible spectrum,
but also that in the two superposed spectra these solutions correspond
exactly. This would be one of the most curious, one
of the most strange results of physics.”&mdash;Taylor’s Scientific
Memoirs.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_129_129" id="Footnote_129_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> The chemical evidence of this will be found in Sir John
Herschel’s Memoir <i>On the Solar Spectrum</i>, and particularly as
exemplified in the changes produced on the tartrate of silver.
Similar influences are described as observed on a Daguerreotype
plate, in a paper entitled <i>Experiments and Observations on Light

observed in many of the photographic processes. In a note to a
memoir <i>On certain improvements in Photographic processes</i>,
Sir John Herschel thus refers to this property:&mdash;“The excitement
is produced on such paper by the ordinary moisture of the atmosphere,
and goes on slowly working its effect in the dark, apparently
without other limit than is afforded by the supply of ingredients
present. In the case of silver it ultimately produces a perfect
<i>silvering</i> of all the sunned portions. Very singular and beautiful
photographs, having much resemblance to Daguerreotype pictures,
are thus produced; the negative character changing by keeping,
and by quite insensible gradations to positive, and the shades exhibiting
a most singular <i>chatoyant</i> change of colour from ruddy-brown
to black, when held more or less obliquely. No doubt, also,
gold pictures with the metallic lustre might be obtained by the
same process, though I have not tried the experiment.”</p></div>

<p class="p2">If a piece of amber, <i>electrum</i>, is briskly rubbed, it
acquires the property of attracting light bodies. This
curious power excited the attention of Thales of Miletus;
and from the investigations of this Grecian philosopher
we must date our knowledge of one of the most important
of the natural forces&mdash;Electricity.</p>

<p>If an inquiring mind had not been led to ask why
does this curious natural production attract a feather, the
present age, in all probability, would not have been in
possession of the means by which it is enabled to transmit
intelligence with a rapidity which equals the poet’s
dream of the “swift-winged messengers of thought.”
To this age of application a striking lesson does this
amber teach. Modern utility would have regarded
Thales as a madman. Holding a piece of yellow resin
in his hand, rubbing it, and then picking up bits of down,
or catching floating feathers, the old Greek would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>
appeared a very imbecile, and the <i>cui bono</i> generation
would have laughed at his silly labours. But when he
announced to his school that this amber held a soul or
essence, which was awakened by friction, and went forth
from the body in which it previously lay dormant, and
brought back the small particles floating around it, he
gave to the world the first hint of a great truth which has
advanced our knowledge of physical phenomena in a marvellous
manner, and ministered to the refinements and to
the necessities of civilisation. Each phenomenon which
presents itself to us, however simple it may appear to be,
is an outward expression of some internal truth, the interpretation
of which is only to be arrived at by assiduous
study, but which, once discovered, directs the way to new
knowledge, and gives to man a great increase of power.
There is no truth so abstract that it will not find its useful
application, and every example of the ministration of
Physical Science to the purposes of humanity is an evidence
of the value of abstract study, and a reply to the
utilitarian in his own language.</p>

<p>Electricity appears to be diffused through all nature;
and it is, beyond all doubt, one of the most important
of the physical forces, in the great phenomena of creation.
In the thunder-cloud, swelling with destruction,
it resides, ready to launch its darts and shake the earth
with its explosions: in the aërial undulations, silent
and unseen, it passes, giving the necessary excitement
to the organisms around which it floats. The rain-drop&mdash;the
earth-girdling ocean&mdash;and the ringing waters
of the hill-born river, hold locked this mighty force.
The solid rocks&mdash;the tenacious clays which rest upon
them&mdash;the superficial soils&mdash;and the incoherent sands,
give us evidence of the presence of this agency; and in
the organic world, whether animal or vegetable, the excitement
of electrical force is always to be detected.</p>

<p>In the solar radiations we have perhaps the prime mover
of this power. In our atmosphere, when calm and cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>less,
a great ocean of light, or when sombre with the
mighty aspect of the dire tornado, we can constantly
detect the struggle between the elements of matter to
maintain an equilibrium of electrical force.</p>

<p>Diffused throughout matter, electricity is ever active;
but it must be remembered that although it is evidently
a necessary agent in all the operations of nature, that it
is not the agent to which everything unknown is to be
referred. Doubtless the influence of this force is more
extensive than we have yet discovered; but that is an
indolent philosophy which refers, without examination,
every mysterious phenomenon to the influence of electricity.</p>

<p>The question, what is electricity? has ever perplexed,
and still continues to agitate, the world of science.
While one set of experimentalists have endeavoured to
explain the phenomena they have witnessed, upon the
theory that electricity is a peculiar subtile fluid pervading
matter, and possessing singular powers of attraction
and repulsion, another party find themselves compelled
to regard the phenomena as giving evidence of the action
of two fluids which are always in opposite states; while
again, electricity has been considered by others as, like
the attraction of gravitation, a mere property of matter.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Certain it is, that in the manifestations of electrical phenomena
we have, as it appears, the evidence of two conditions
of force; but of the states of <i>positive</i> or <i>negative</i>, of
<i>vitreous</i> or <i>resinous</i> electricity, we have a familiar explanation
in the assumption of some current flowing into or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span>
out of the material body,&mdash;of some principle which is
ever active in maintaining its equilibrium, which, consequently,
must act in two directions, and always exhibit
that duality which is a striking characteristic of this
subtile agent. It is a curious, and it should be an
instructive fact, that each of the three theories of electricity
is capable of proof, and has, indeed, been most
ably supported by the rigorous analysis of mathematics.
When we remember that some of the most enlightened
investigators of this and the past age have severally
maintained, in the most able manner, these dissimilar
views, we should hesitate before we pronounce an opinion
upon the cause or causes of the very complicated phenomena
of electrical force.</p>

<p>Although we discover, in all the processes of nature,
the manifestations of this principle or force in its characteristic
conditions, it will be necessary, before we
regard the great phenomena, to examine the known
sources from which we can most readily evoke the
mighty power of electricity. If we rub a piece of glass
or resin, we readily render this agent active; these substances
appear, by this excitement, to become surrounded
by an attractive or a repellent atmosphere. Let us rub
a strip of writing paper with Indian rubber, or a strip
of Gutta Percha with the fingers, in the dark, and we
have the manifestation of several curious phenomena.
We have a peculiar attracting power; we have a luminous
discharge in the shape of a spark; and we have
very sensible evidence of muscular disturbance produced
by applying the knuckle to the surface of the material.
In each case we have the development of the same
power.</p>

<p>Every substance in nature is an electric, and, if so
disposed that its electricity may not fly off as it is developed,
we may, by friction, manifest its presence, and,
indeed, measure its quantity or its force. All bodies
are not, however, equally good electrics; shell-lac,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
amber, resins, sulphur, and glass, exhibiting more powerfully
the phenomena of frictional or mechanical electricity,
than the metals, charcoal, or plumbago. Solid
bodies allow this peculiar principle to pass along them
also in very different degrees. Thus electricity travels
readily through copper and most other metals, platinum
being the worst metallic conductor. It also passes
through living animals and vegetables, smoke, vapour,
rarified air, and moist earth; but it is obstructed by
resins and glass, paper when dry, oils, and dry metallic
oxides, and in a very powerful manner by Gutta Percha.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span></p>
<p>If, therefore, we place an electric upon any of those
non-conducting bodies, the air around being well dried,
we are enabled to gather a large quantity of the force
for the production of any particular effect. Taking advantage
of this fact, arrangements are made for the
accumulation and liberation at pleasure of any amount
of electricity.</p>

<p>A Leyden phial,&mdash;so called from its inventor, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Muschenbrock">Musschenbroek</span>,
having resided at Leyden,&mdash;is merely a glass bottle
lined within and without, to within a few inches of the
top, with a metal coating. If a wire or chain, carrying
an electric current, is allowed to dip to the bottom of
the bottle, the inner coat of the jar becomes charged,
or gathers an excess, whilst the outer one is in its natural
condition&mdash;one is said to be in a <i>positive</i>, and the other in
a <i>negative</i> state. If the two coatings are now connected
by a good conductor, as a piece of copper wire, passing
from one to the other, the outside to the inside, a discharge,
arising from the establishment of the equilibrium
of the two coatings, takes place; and, if the connection
is made through the medium of our bodies,
we are sensible of a severe disturbance of the nervous
system.</p>

<p>The cause of the conducting and non-conducting
powers of bodies we know not; they bear some relation
to their conducting powers for caloric; but they are not
in exact obedience to the same laws. When we consider
that resin, a comparatively soft body, in which, conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>quently,
cohesive attraction is not very strong, is an imperfect
conductor, and that copper, in which cohesion is
much more powerful, is a good conductor, we may be
disposed to consider that it is regulated by the closer approximation
of the particles of matter. But in platinum
the corpuscular arrangement must be much more dense
than it is in copper, and yet it is, compared with it, a
very bad conductor.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>We have now learnt that we may, by friction, excite
the electricity in a vitreous substance; but it must not
be forgotten that we cannot increase the quantity which
is, under ordinary conditions, natural to the electric; to
do so, we must in some way establish a channel of communication
with the earth, from which, through the
medium we excite, we draw our supply. We have the
means of confining this mighty force within certain limits
of quantity and of time. If we place bodies which are
susceptible of electrical excitation in a sensible degree
upon insulating ones, we may retain for a considerable
time the evidences of the excitement, in the same way as
with the Leyden jar; but there is a constant effort to
maintain a balance of conditions, and the body in which
we have accumulated any extraordinary quantity by conduction
soon returns to its natural state.</p>

<p>A very simple means may be adopted of showing what
is thought to be one of the many evidences in favour of
two electricities. If the wire carrying the current flowing
from the machine, is passed over paper covered with
nitrate of silver, it produces no change upon it; but if
the wire which conveys the current to the instrument,
when it is excited, is passed over the same paper, the
silver salt is decomposed.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> We may, however, explain
this result in a satisfactory manner, upon the hypothesis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
that the decomposition is produced by the abstraction of
electricity, rather than by any physical difference in the
fluid itself. By frictional electricity we may produce
curious molecular disturbances, and give rise to molecular
re-arrangements, which have been called “electrical
images,” in glass, in stone, and in the apparently less
tractable metals: these images are rendered visible by
the manner in which, according to their electrical states,
some lines receive any particular powder, or vapour,
which is repelled from other spaces. Many of the great
natural phenomena, such as Lightning and Thunder, the
Aurora Borealis, and Meteors, may be imitated in a
curiously exact manner by the electrical machine and a
few familiar arrangements.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Voltaic electricity, as the active force produced by
chemical change is commonly called, in honour of the
illustrious Volta, is now to be considered. It differs
from frictional electricity in this:&mdash;the electricity developed
by friction of the glass plate or cylinder of the
electrical machine is a discharge with a sort of explosion.
It is electricity suddenly liberated from the highest state
of tension, whereas that which is generated by chemical
action in the voltaic battery is a steady flowing current.
We may compare one to the ignition of a mass of gunpowder
at once, and the other to the slow burning of
the same quantity spread out into a very prolonged
train.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways in which we may excite the
phenomena of Voltaism, but in all of them the decomposition
of one of the elements employed appears to be
necessary. This is the case in the arrangements of batteries
in which two dissimilar metals, zinc and copper,
silver and platinum, or the like, is immersed in fluids;
the zinc or the silver are gradually converted into soluble
salts, which are dissolved, whilst the copper or platinum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
is protected from any action. The most simple manner
of illustrating the development of this electricity is by
placing a piece of silver on the tongue, and a piece of
zinc or lead underneath it. No effect will be observed
so long as the two metals are kept asunder, but when
their edges are brought together, a slight tremulous sensation
will pass through the tongue, a saline taste be
distinguished by the palate, and if in the dark, light will
be observed by the eye.</p>

<p>This, the germ of the most remarkable of the sciences,
was noticed by Sulzar, fifty years before Galvani observed
the convulsions in the limbs of frogs, when excited by
the action of dissimilar metals; but the former paid
little attention to the phenomenon, and the discovery
led to no results.</p>

<p>When Galvani’s observant mind was directed to the
remarkable fact that the mere contact of two dissimilar
metals with the moist surface of living muscles produced
convulsions, there was an awakening in the soul of that
philosopher to a great fundamental truth, which was
nurtured by him, tried and tested, and preserved to work
its marvels for future ages.</p>

<p>Although the world of science looks back to Volta as
the man who gave the first true interpretation of this
discovery, yet the ordinary world will never disconnect
this important branch of physical science from the
name of Galvani, and chemical electricity in all its
forms will for ever be known under the familiar name of
Galvanism. And it must not be forgotten, that the
phenomena of the manifestation of electricity, in connection
with the conditions of vitality, are entirely due to
Galvani.</p>

<p>Let us examine the phenomena of Galvanism in its
most simple phases:&mdash;</p>

<p>If we place a live flounder upon a plate of zinc, put a
shilling on its back, and then touch both metals with
the ends of a metallic wire, the fish will exhibit painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
convulsions. The zinc becomes oxidized by the separation
of oxygen from the fluid on the surface with which
it is in contact, whilst hydrogen gas is liberated at that
surface touched by the other metal. Here we have, in
the first place, a chemical change effected, then a peculiar
muscular disturbance. Each successive combination
or decomposition, like a pulsation, is transmitted along
the circuit from one extremity to the other. How the
impulse which is derived from the zinc is transmitted
through the body of the animal, or the tongue, to the
silver or copper is the next consideration.</p>

<p>We can only understand this upon the supposition
that a series of impulses are communicated in the most
rapid manner along the connecting line; the idea of a
current, although the term is commonly employed, tends
to convey an imperfect impression to the mind. It
would seem rather that a disturbance throughout the
entire circuit is at once set up by a series of vibrations
or impulses communicated from particle to particle, and
along the strange net-work of nerves. One set of chemical
elements have a tendency to develope themselves
at that point where vibration is first communicated to
the mass from a better conductor than it is, and another
set at the point where it passes from the body to a better
conductor than itself. The cause of this is to be sought
for in the laws which regulate molecular constitution&mdash;by
which chemical affinity is disturbed,&mdash;and a new
attractive force exerted, in obedience to which the vital
energy is itself agitated. We must not, however, forget
that it is probable after all, although not yet susceptible
of proof, that the electricity does nothing more than disturb
or quicken the unknown principles upon which chemical
and vital phenomena depend; being, indeed, a
secondary agent.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding our long acquaintance with the phenomena
of galvanism, there are but few who entertain a
correct idea of the enormous amount of electricity which
is necessary to the existing conditions of matter. To
Faraday we are indebted for the first clear set of deductions
from a series of inductive researches, which are of
the most complete order. He has proved, by a series
of exceedingly conclusive experiments, that if the electrical
power which holds a grain of water in combination,
or which causes a grain of oxygen and hydrogen to unite
in the right proportions to form water, could be collected
and thrown into the condition of a voltaic current, it
would be exactly the quantity required to produce the
decomposition of that grain of water, or the liberation of
its elements, hydrogen and oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>By direct experiment it has been proved that one equivalent
of zinc in a voltaic arrangement evolves such a
quantity of electricity in the form of a current, as, passing
through water, will decompose exactly one equivalent
of that fluid. The law has been thus expressed:&mdash;The
electricity which decomposes, and that which is evolved
by the decomposition of a certain quantity of matter, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span>
alike. The equivalent weights of bodies are those quantities
of them which contain equal quantities of electricity;
electricity determining the equivalent number,
because it determines the combining force.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The same elegant and correct experimentalist has
shown that zinc and platinum wires, one-eighteenth of
an inch in diameter, and about half an inch long, dipped
into water in which is mixed sulphuric acid so weak
that it is not sensibly sour to the tongue, will evolve
more electricity in one-twentieth of a minute than is
given by thirty turns of a large and powerful plate electrical
machine in full action, a quantity which, if passed
through the head of a cat, is sufficient to kill it as by a
flash of lightning. Pursuing this interesting inquiry
yet further, it is found that a single grain of water contains
as much electricity as could be accumulated in
800,000 Leyden jars, each requiring thirty turns of the
large machine of the Royal Institution to charge it,&mdash;a
quantity equal to that which is developed from a
charged thunder-cloud. “Yet we have it under perfect
command,&mdash;can evolve, direct, and employ it at pleasure;
and when it has performed its full work of electrolisation,
it has only separated the elements of a single
grain of water.”</p>

<p>It has been argued by many that the realities of
science will not admit of anything like a poetic view
without degrading its high office; that poetry, being
the imaginative side of nature, has nothing in common
with the facts of experimental research, or with the
philosophy which generalises the discoveries of severe
induction. If our science was perfect, and laid bare to
our senses all the secrets of the inner world; if our
philosophy was infallible, and always connected one fact
with another through a long series up to the undoubted
cause of all&mdash;then poetry, in the sense we now use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
term, would have little business with the truth; it
would, indeed, be lost or embodied, like the stars of
heaven, in the brightness of a meridian sun. But to
take our present fact as an example, how important a
foundation does it offer upon which to build a series of
thoughts, capable of lifting the human mind above the
materialities by which it is surrounded,&mdash;of exalting
each common nature by the refinement of its fresh ideas
to a point higher in the scale of intelligence,&mdash;of quickening
every impulse of the soul,&mdash;and of giving to
mankind the most holy longings.</p>

<p>What does science tell us of the drop of water? Two
gases, the one exciting life and quickening combustion,
the other a highly inflammable air, are, by the influence
of a combination of powers, brought into a liquid globe.
We can, from this crystal sphere, evoke heat, light,
electricity, and actinism in enormous quantities; and
beyond these we can see powers or forces, for which, in
the poverty of our ideas and our words, we have not
names; and we learn that each one of these principles
is engaged in maintaining the conditions of the drop of
water which refreshes organic nature, and gives gladness
to man’s dwelling-place.</p>

<p>Has poetry a nobler theme than this? Agencies are
seen like winged spirits of infinite power, each one
working in its own peculiar way, and all to a common
end,&mdash;to produce, under the guidance of omnipotent
rule, the waters of the rivers and the seas. As the
great ocean mirrors the bright heaven which overspreads
it, and reflects back the sunlight and the sheen of the
midnight stars in grandeur and loveliness; so every
drop of water, viewed with the knowledge which science
has given to us, sends back to the mind reflections of
yet distant truths which, rightly followed, will lead us
upwards and onwards in the tract of higher intelligences,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>In the discoveries connected with electricity, we have
results of a more tangible character than are as yet connected
with the other physical forces; and it does appear
that this science has advanced our knowledge of nature
and of the mysteries of creation far more extensively
than any other department of purely experimental
inquiry.</p>

<p>The phenomena of electro-chemical action are so
strange that we must return for a moment to the consideration
of the decomposition of water, and the
appearance of hydrogen at one pole, and of oxygen at
the other. It appears that some confusion of our ideas
has arisen from the views which have been received of
the atomic constitution of bodies. We have been
accustomed to regard water,&mdash;to take that body as an
example of all,&mdash;as a compound of two gases, hydrogen
and oxygen; an equivalent, or one atom of the first,
united to an equivalent or one atom of the last,
forming one atom of water. This atom of water we
regard as infinitely small; consequently a drop of water
is made up of many hundreds of these combined atoms,
and a pint of water of not less than 10,000 drops. Now,
if this pint of water is connected with the wires of
a galvanic battery, although their extremities may be
some inches apart, for every atom of oxygen liberated at
one pole, an atom of hydrogen is set free at the other.
It has been thought that an atom has undergone
decomposition at one point, its oxygen being torn from
it, and then there has arisen the difficulty of sending
the atom of hydrogen through all the combined atoms
of water across to the other pole. A series of decompositions
and recompositions have been supposed to take
place, and the communication of effects from particle to
particle.</p>

<p>An attracting power for one class of bodies has been
found in one pole, which is repellent to another class;
and the reverse order has been detected at the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
pole of a galvanic arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> That is, the wire
which carries the current from an excited zinc plate
has a relation to all bodies, which is directly opposite to
that which is exhibited by the wire conveying the current
from, or completing the circuit with, the copper
plate. The one, for instance, collects and carries acids
and the like, the other the metallic bases. At the
extremity of one galvanic wire, placed into a drop of
water, oxygen is always liberated; and at the end of
the other, necessary to complete the circuit with the
battery, hydrogen is set free.</p>

<p>It appears necessary, to a clear understanding of
what takes place in this experiment, that we should
regard each mass, howsoever large, as the representative
of a single atom. Nor is this difficult, as the following
illustration will show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Let us take one particle of common salt (<i>chloride</i> of
<i>sodium</i>) weighing less than a grain, and put it into a
hundred thousand grains of distilled water. In a few
minutes the salt has diffused itself through the whole of the
fluid, and in every drop we can detect chlorine and soda.
We cannot believe that this grain of salt has split itself
up into a hundred thousand parts; we conceive rather
that the phenomenon of solution is one of diffusion.
One infinitely elastic body has interpenetrated with
another.</p>

<p>Instead of an experiment with a pint of water, let us
take our stand on Dover heights, and, with a gigantic
battery at our command, place one wire into the ocean
on our own shores, and convey the other through the
air across the channel, and let its extremity dip into the
sea off Calais pier&mdash;the experiment is a practicable one&mdash;we
have now an electrical circuit of which the British
channel forms a part, and the result will be exactly the
same as that which we may observe in a watch-glass
with a drop of water.</p>

<p>We cannot suppose that the instantaneous and
simultaneous effect which takes place in the water at
Calais and at Dover, is due to anything like what we
have studied under the name of convection, when
considering Heat.</p>

<p>A thousand balls are placed in a line touching each
other; the first ball receives a blow, and the last ball
flies off with a force exactly equal to the power applied
to the first; none of the intermediate balls being
moved.</p>

<p>We cannot conceive that the particle <i>A</i> excites the
particle <i>B</i> next it, and so on through the series between
the two shores; but regarding the channel as one large
drop, charged with the electric principle as we know it
to be, it is excited by undulation or tremor throughout
its width, and we have an equivalent of oxygen thrown
off on one side of the line, and an exact equivalent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
hydrogen at the other, the electro-chemical influence
being exerted only where the current or motion is
transferred from one medium to another.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The imperfect
character of this view is freely admitted; no
other, consistent with known facts, presents itself by
which the effect can be explained. The fact stands as a
truth; the hypothesis by which it is attempted to be
interpreted is open to doubt, and it is opposed to some
favourite theories.</p>

<p>Before we pass to the consideration of the other
sources of electricity, it is important we should understand
that no chemical or physical change, however
slight it may be, can occur without the development of
electrical power. If we dissolve a salt in water, if we
mix two fluids together, if we condense a gas, or convert
a fluid into vapour, electricity is disturbed, and may be
made manifest to our senses.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>It has been shown that this power may be excited by
friction (machine electricity) and by chemical action
(voltaic electricity, galvanism); it now remains to speak
of the electricity developed by heat (thermo-electricity),
the electricity exhibited under nervous excitement by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
the gymnotus and torpedo (animal electricity); magnetism
and its phenomena being reserved for a separate
consideration.</p>

<p>If a bar of metal is warmed at one end and kept cool
at the other, an electrical current circulates through the
bar, and may be carried off by connection with any
good conductor, and shown to exhibit the properties of
ordinary electricity. The metals best suited for showing
the effects of thermo-electricity appear to be bismuth
and antimony. By binding two bars of these metals
together at one end, and connecting the other ends with
a galvanometer, it will be discovered that an electric
current passes off through the instrument by the
slightest variation of temperature. Merely clasping
the two metals, where bound together, with the finger
and thumb, is sufficient to exhibit the phenomenon.
By a series of such arrangements,&mdash;which form what
have been called thermo-electric multipliers,&mdash;we
obtain the most delicate measurers of heat with which
philosophers are acquainted, by the aid of which
Melloni has been enabled to pursue his beautiful
researches on radiant caloric.</p>

<p>That this electricity is identical with the other forms
has been proved by employing the current thus excited
for the purpose of producing chemical decomposition,
magnetism, and electric light.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The phenomenon of thermo-electricity&mdash;the discovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
of Seebeck, is another proof of the very close connection
of the physical forces. We witness their being resolved
as it were into each other, electricity producing heat,
and heat again electricity; and it is from these curious
results that the arguments in favour of their intimate
relations and actual identity have been drawn. It will,
however, be found to be the best philosophy to regard
these forces as dissimilar, until we are enabled to prove
them to be only modified forms of one principle or
power. At the same time it must not be forgotten that
in natural operations we invariably find the combined
action of several forces producing a single phenomenon.
The important fact to be particularly regarded is, that
we have evidence that every substance which is unequally
heated becomes the source of this very remarkable
form of electricity.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>There exist a few fishes gifted with the very extraordinary
power of producing electrical phenomena
by an effort of muscular or nervous energy.</p>

<p>The <i>Gymnotus electricus</i>, or electrical eel, and the
<i>Raia torpedo</i>, a species of ray, are the most remarkable.
This power is, it would appear, given to these curious
creatures for purposes of defence, and also for enabling
them to secure their prey. The <i>Gymnotus</i> of the South
America rivers, will, it is said, when in full vigour, send
forth a discharge of electricity sufficiently powerful to
knock down a man, or to stun a horse; while it can
destroy fishes, through a considerable space, by exerting
its strange artillery.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Faraday’s description of a <i>Gymnotus</i>, paralyzing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
seizing its prey, is too graphic and important to be
omitted.</p>

<p>“The <i>Gymnotus</i> can stun and kill fish which are in
very various positions to its own body; but on one day,
when I saw it eat, its action seemed to me to be
peculiar. A live fish, about five inches in length,
caught not half a minute before, was dropped into the
tub. The <i>Gymnotus</i> instantly turned round in such a
manner as to form a coil, inclosing the fish, the latter
representing a diameter across it; a shock passed, and
there, in an instant, was the fish struck motionless, as
if by lightning, in the midst of the waters, its side
floating to the light. The <i>Gymnotus</i> made a turn or
two to look for its prey, which, having found, he bolted,
and then went about searching for more. A second
smaller fish was given him, which being hurt in the
conveyance, showed but little signs of life, and this he
swallowed at once, apparently without shocking it. The
coiling of the <i>Gymnotus</i> round its prey had, in this case,
every appearance of being intentional on its part, to
increase the force of the shock, and the action is evidently
well suited for that purpose, being in full
accordance with the well-known laws of the discharge
of currents in masses of conducting matter; and though
the fish may not always put this artifice in practice, it is
very probable he is aware of its advantages, and may
resort to it in cases of need.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Animal electricity has been proved to be of the same
character as that derived from other sources. The
shock and the spark are like those of the machine; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
the current from the animal, circulating around soft
iron, like galvanic electricity, has the property of rendering
it magnetic.</p>

<p>It is important that we should now review these
conditions of electrical force in connexion with the great
physical phenomena of nature.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently evident, from the results which have
been examined, that all matter, whatever may be its
form or condition, is for ever under the operation of the
physical forces, in a state of disturbance. From the
centre to the surface all is in an active condition: a
state of mutation prevails with every created thing; and
science clearly shows that influences are constantly in
action which prevent the possibility of absolute repose.</p>

<p>Under the excitement of the several agencies of the
solar beams, motion is given to all bodies by the circulation
of heat, and a full flow of electricity is sent
around the earth to perform its wondrous works. The solar
influences, which regulate, and possibly determine, every
physical force with which we are acquainted, are active
in effecting an actual change of state in matter. The
sunbeam of the morning falls on the solid earth, and its
influence is felt to the very centre. The mountain-top
catches the first ray of light, and its base, still wrapt in
mists and darkness, is disturbed by the irradiating
power. The crystalline gems, hidden in the darkness of
the solid rock, are dependent, for that form which
makes them valued by the proud and gay, on the
influence of those radiations which they are one day to
refract in beauty. The metals locked in the chasms of
the rifted rocks are, for all their physical peculiarities,
as dependent on solar influence as is the flower which
lifts its head to the morning sun, or the bird which sings
“at heaven’s high gate.”</p>

<p>Let us, then, examine how far electricity, as distinguished
from the other powers, acts in producing any
of these effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>We find electricity in the atmosphere, which the
electrical kite of Dr. Franklin proved to be identical
with that principle produced by the friction of glass. In
the grandeur and terror of a thunderstorm, many see
nothing but manifestations of Almighty wrath. When
the volleys of the bursting cloud are piercing the
disturbed air, and the thunders of the discharge are
pealing their dreadful notes above our heads, the
chemical combinations of the noxious exhalations
arising from the putrefying animal and vegetable
masses of this earth are effected, elements fitted for the
purposes of health and vegetation are formed, and
brought to the ground in the heavy rains which usually
follow these storms. Science has taught man this&mdash;has
shown him that the “partial evil” arising from the
“winged bolt” is a “universal good;” and, more than
this, it has armed him with the means of protecting his
life and property from the influence of lightnings. So
that, like Ajax, he can defy the storm. By metallic
rods, carried up a chimney, a tower, or a mast, we may
form a channel through which the whole of the
electricity of the most terrific thunder-cloud may be
carried harmlessly into the earth or the sea; and it is
pleasing to observe that at length prejudice has been
overcome, and “conductors” are generally attached to
high buildings, and to most of the ships of our navy.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
It was discovered that the devastating hailstorms of the
south of France and Switzerland, so destructive to the
vineyards and crops, were accompanied by evidences of
great electrical excitation, and it was proposed to discharge
the electricity from the air by means of pointed
metallic rods. These have been adopted, and, it is said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
with real advantage&mdash;each rod protecting an area of one
hundred yards. Thus it is that science ministers to our
service; and how much more pleasing is it to contemplate
the lightning, with the philosopher, as an agent
destroying the elements of pestilence, and restoring the
healthfulness of the air we breathe, than with the
romancer, to see in it only the dreaded aspect of a
demon of destruction.</p>

<p>The laws which regulate the spread of a pestilence
are unknown. The difficulties of the investigation are
great, but they are by no means insurmountable. A
plague passes from the east to the west across the world&mdash;it
spreads mourning over the gayest cities, and sorrow
sitteth in the streets. The black death rises in the
Orient: it goes on in unchecked strength, and only
finishes its course when it has made the circuit of the
civilized world. The cholera spreads its ebon wings&mdash;mankind
trembles&mdash;watches its progress, and looks
upon the path which is marked by the myriads of the
dead, who have fallen before the dire fiend. The
diseases pass away&mdash;the dead are buried, and all is
forgotten. The rush and the riot of life are pursued:
and until man is threatened with another advent, he
cares not to trouble himself. Accompanying the last
visitation, there appear certain peculiar meteorological
conditions, which point a line of inquiry. It may or
may not be the path which leads to the truth, but
certainly its indications are worthy of careful examination.
It may be asked, can weak man stop a
pestilence; can a mortal’s puny hand retard the afflictions
of the Almighty? The question asked&mdash;it must
be answered in reverence, yet without fear. No
human power can produce a change in the physical conditions
of the earth, or of the air; and if our diseases
are connected with those changes, as beyond all doubt
a number of them are, they lie above man’s control.
But when there are indications that causes secondary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
these are producing some dire effect, and when we
know that these secondary causes may be modified, it is
sufficient evidence to prove that man is permitted to
control thus far the afflictions which are sent to try his
powers.</p>

<p>We find a disease winging its way from lane to alley
and closed court, sweeping with destructive violence its
way through damp cellars and crowded attics; it is rife
with mischief along the banks of reeking ditches, and
on the borders of filthy streams. Certain it is, therefore,
that some ultimate connexion exists between the conditions
of dirt and this speedy death. Can science tell
of these? has it yet searched out the connecting link?
Let the question be answered by a few facts.</p>

<p>When the cholera first made its appearance, and
subsequently, it has been observed that the electrical
intensity of the atmosphere was unusually low.</p>

<p>The disease has departed, and it is then found that
the electricity of the air has been restored to its ordinary
condition.</p>

<p>This appears to show some connexion; but how do
these conditions link this physical force with the ditch-seeking
disease?</p>

<p>From all stagnant places, from all the sinks of overcrowded
humanity, from fermenting vegetable and from
putrefying animal matter, there are constantly arising
poisonous exhalations to do their work of destruction.</p>

<p>Where death and decay is a law, this must of necessity
constantly occur; but the poisonous reek may be diffused,
or it may be concentrated, and Nature has provided
for this, and ordered the means for rendering the
poison harmless.</p>

<p>By the agency of electricity,&mdash;probably, too, by the
influence of light,&mdash;the oxygen in the air undergoes a
peculiar change, by which it is rendered far more energetic
than it is in its ordinary state. This is the condition
to which the name of <i>ozone</i> has been applied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
Now, this ozone, or this peculiar oxygen, always exists
in the air we breathe; but its quantity is subject to great
and rapid variations. It is found that when electrical
intensity is high the quantity of this principle is great;
when the electrical intensity is low, as in the cholera
years, the proportion of ozone is relatively low.</p>

<p>This remarkable chemical agent possesses the power
of instantly combining with organic matter,&mdash;of removing
with singular rapidity all noxious odours; and
it would appear to be the most active of all known
disinfectants.</p>

<p>May we not infer from the facts stated that the pestilence
we dread is the result of organic poison, which
from a deficiency of ozone,&mdash;its natural antidote,&mdash;exerts
its baneful influences on humanity. This deficiency is
due to alterations in the electrical character of the air,
possibly dependent upon phenomena taking place in the
sun itself, or it may be still more directly influenced by
variations in the character of solar light, which we have
not yet detected, by which the conditions of the electric
power are determined.</p>

<p>This may be a line along which it is fair to push enquiry.
But such an enquiry must be made in all the
purity of the highest inductive philosophy, and speculation
must be held firmly in the controlling chains of
experiment and observation. In the truths, however,
which are known to us, there is so much harmony and
consistence that even the melancholy theme links itself&mdash;a
tragedy&mdash;with the Poetry of Science.</p>

<p>It has been thought, and much satisfactory evidence
has been brought forward to support the idea, that the
earth’s magnetism is due to currents of electricity
circulating around the globe; as a great natural current
from east to west&mdash;that, indeed, it has an unvarying
reference to the motion of the earth in relation to the sun.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span></p>
<p>These terrestrial currents, as they have without doubt
a very important bearing on the structural conditions
of the rock-formations and the distribution of minerals,
require an attentive consideration; but we must, in the
first place, examine, as far as we know, the influences
exerted, or supposed to be exerted, by electricity, in its
varied forms.</p>

<p>The phenomena of vitality have, by many, been considered
as immediately dependent upon its influence;
and a rather extensive series of experiments has been
made in support of this hypothesis. The researches
of Philip on the action of the organs of digestion, when
separated from their connection with the brain, but
united with a galvanic battery, have been proved by
Dr. Reid to be delusive;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> since, as the organ is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
removed from the influence of the living principle, it is
quite evident that the electricity here is only secondary
to some more important power. Matteucci has endeavoured
to show that nervous action is intimately
connected with electric excitation, and that electricity
may be made a measurer of nervous <span class="correction" title="In the original book: iritability">irritability</span>.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> There
can be no doubt that a peculiar susceptibility to excitement
exists in some systems, and this is very strikingly
shown in the disturbances produced by electric action;
but in the experiments which have been brought forward
we have only the evidence that a certain number
of muscular contractions are exhibited in one animal by
a current of electricity, giving a measured effect by the
voltameter, which are different from those produced
upon another by a current of the same power. An
attempt has recently been made by Mr. A. Smee to
reduce the electrical phenomena connected with vitality
to a more exact system than had hitherto been done.
We cannot, however, regard the attempt as successful.
The author has trusted almost entirely to analogical
reasoning, which is in science always dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In
the development of electricity during the operation of
the vital force, we see only the phenomena produced
by the action of any two dissimilar chemical compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
upon each other. It has been thought that the structure
of the brain presents an analogy to that of the galvanic
battery, and the nerves represent the conducting wires.
Although, however, some of the conditions appear
similar, there are many which have no representatives
in either the mechanical structure or the physical
properties of the brain, so far as we know it. That the
brain is the centre, the source, and termination of sensation
is very clearly proved by physiological investigations.
That the nerves are the media by which all
sensation is conveyed to the brain, and also the instruments
by which the will exerts its power over the
muscles, is equally well established. But to say that we
have any evidence to support the idea that electricity
has aught to do directly with these great physiological
phenomena, would be a bold assertion, betraying a want
of due caution on the part of the investigator. That
electric effects are developed during the operations of
vitality is most certain. Such must be the case, from
the chemical changes taking place during respiration
and digestion, and the mechanical movements by which,
even during external repose, the necessary functions of
the body are carried on. Whether electricity is the
cause of these, or an effect arising from them, we need
not stop to examine, as this is, in the present state of
our knowledge, a mere speculation. We have no evidence
that electricity is an exciting power, but rather
that it is one of those forces which tend to establish
the equilibrium of matter. When disturbed&mdash;when its
equilibrium is overset&mdash;it does, in its efforts to regain
its stability, produce most remarkable effects. An
electrical machine must be rubbed to exhibit any force.
In all galvanic arrangements, even the most simple,
dissimilar bodies are brought together, and the latent
electricity of both is disturbed; and, even in the magnet,
it is only when this takes place that its electrical powers
are developed. In the <i>Gymnotus</i>, electricity appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
be dependent upon the power of the will of the animal;
but even in this extraordinary fish, it is only under peculiar
conditions that the electrical excitement takes
place, and “what they inflict, they feel” during the
restoration of that equilibrium which is necessary to
their healthy state. In every case, therefore, we see
that some power far superior to this is the ultimate
cause; indeed, light and heat, and probably actinism,
appear to stand superior to this principle; and on these,
in some combined mode of action, in all probability,
sensible electricity is dependent. Beyond even these
elements, largely as they are engaged in the organic
and inorganic changes of this world, there are occult
powers which may never be understood by finite beings.
We advance step by step from the most solid to the
most ethereal of material creations, and we examine a
series of extraordinary effects produced by powers which
we know not whether to regard as material or immaterial,
so subtile are they. On these, it appears, we
may exhaust our inductive investigations&mdash;we may discover
the laws by which these principles act upon the
grosser elements, and develope phenomena of a very
remarkable kind which have been unobserved or misunderstood.
Whether light, heat, and electricity are
modifications of one power, or different powers very
closely united in action, is a problem we may possibly
solve; but to know what they are, appears to be beyond
the hopes of science; and it were idle to dream of
elucidating the causes hidden beyond these forces, and
by which they are regulated in all their actions on dead
or living matter.</p>

<p>M. Du Bois Raymond, from a series of researches
remarkable alike for their difficulty and the delicacy
with which they have been pursued, draws the following,
amongst many others, as his conclusions as to the connection
of electricity and vital phenomena.</p>

<p>The muscles and nerves, including the brain and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
spinal chord, are endowed during life with an electromotive
power, which acts according to a definite law.</p>

<p>The electromotive power <i>lasts after death</i>, or in dissected
nerves and muscles after separation from the
body of the animal, as long as the excitability of the
nervous and muscular fibre; whether these fibres are
permitted to die gradually from the cessation of the
conditions necessary to the support of life, or whether
they are suddenly deprived of their vital properties by
heat or chemical action.</p>

<p>Let us not suppose for a moment that these conclusions
indicate in the remotest degree that electricity
is life,&mdash;that vital power is due to electricity.</p>

<p>During life, with every motion, and, indeed, with
every emotion, whether we move a muscle or exert the
mind, there is a change of state. The result of this is
chemical phenomena,&mdash;heat and electricity; but these are
not life. We excite them equally by giving motion to
a dead mass.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the assertions of those who have
zealously followed the path of Mesmer, and examined,
or they have thought so, the psychological effects dependent
upon some strange physiological conditions,
there is not an experiment on record,&mdash;there is not an
observation worthy of credit, which shows that electricity
has any connection with their results. All around
their subject is uncertainty: doubt involves every
experiment, and deception clouds a large number.
Some few grains of truth, and these are sufficiently
strange, are mixed up in an enormous mass of error.</p>

<p>All the phenomena of life,&mdash;of the <i>vis vitæ</i> or vitality,
are beyond human search. All the physical forces, or
elements, we may examine by the test of experiment:
but the principle on which sensation depends, the principle
even upon which vegetable <i>life</i> depends, cannot
be tested. Life is infinitely superior to every physical
force; it holds them all in control, but is not itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
controlled by them; it keeps its state sacred from
human search,&mdash;the invisible hidden behind the veil of
mortality.</p>

<p>During changes in the electrical conditions of the
earth and atmosphere, vegetables give indications of
being in a peculiar manner influenced by this power.
It is proved by experiments that the leaves of plants
are among the best conductors of electricity, and it
has hence been inferred that it must necessarily be
advantageous to vegetation. That vegetable growth
is, equally with animal growth, subject to electricity,
as one of its quickening powers, must be admitted;
but all experiments which have been fairly tried with
the view of stimulating the growth of plants by its
agency, have given results of a negative character.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
That a galvanic arrangement may produce chemical
changes in the soil, which may be advantageous to the
plant, is probable; but that a plant can be brought to
maturity sooner, or be made to develope itself more
completely, under the direct action of electrical excitation,
appears to be one of those dreams of science
which will have a place amongst the marvels of alchemy
and the fictions of astrology. An attentive examination
of all the conditions necessary for the satisfactory development
of the plant, will render it evident, that
although the ordinary electrical state of the earth and
atmosphere must influence the processes of germination
and vegetable growth, yet that any additional excitement
must be destructive to them. The wonders wrought by
electrical power are marvellous; a magic influence is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
exerted by it, and naturally the inquiring mind is led
at first to believe that electricity is the all-powerful
principle of creation; but a little reflection will serve
to convince us that it is a subordinate agent, although
a powerful one.</p>

<p>In proceeding with our examination of the phenomena
which present themselves in connection with
the terrestrial currents, we purposely separate magnetism
from those more distinct electro-chemical agencies
which play so important a part in the great cosmical
operations.</p>

<p>Electricity, we have already stated, flows through or
involves all bodies; but, like heat, it appears to undergo
a very remarkable change in becoming associated with
some forms of matter. We have the phenomena of
magnetism when an electric current circulates through
a metallic wire, and it would appear that all other bodies
acquire a peculiar polar condition under the influence of
this principle, which will be explained in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The rocks, taken as masses, will not conduct an
electric current when dry: granite, porphyry, slate, and
limestone, obstructing its passage even through the
smallest spaces. But all the metallic formations admit
of its circulating with great freedom. This fact it must,
however, be remembered does not in any way interfere
with the hypothesis of the existence of electricity in all
bodies, in what we must regard as its latent state, from
which, under prescribed conditions, it may be readily
liberated. Neither does it affect the question of circulation,
in relation to the great diffusion of electricity
which we suppose to exist through all nature, and to
move in obedience to some fixed law. We know that
through the superficial strata electric currents circulate
freely, whether they are composed of clay, sand, or any
mixture of these with decomposed organic matter;
indeed, that with any substance in a moist state they
suffer no interruption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>The electricity of mineral veins has attracted much
attention, and numerous investigations into the phenomena
which these metalliferous formations present, have
been made from time to time.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>By inserting into the mass of a copper <i>lode</i>, or vein, in
situ, a metallic wire, which shall be connected with a measurer
of galvanic action, a wire also from the instrument
being brought into contact with another <i>lode</i>, an immediate
effect is generally produced, showing that a current is
traversing through the wires from one <i>lode</i> to the other,
and completing the circulation probably over the dark
face of the rock in which the fissures forming the
mineral veins exist.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The currents thus detected are
often sufficiently active to deflect a magnetic needle
powerfully, to produce, slowly, electro-chemical decomposition,
and to render a bar of iron magnetic. These
currents must not be confounded with the great
electrical movements around the earth. They are
only to be detected in those mineral formations in which
there is evidence of chemical action going on, and, the
greater the amount of this chemical operation, the more
energetic are the electrical currents.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> We have, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>ever,
very good evidence that these local currents have,
of themselves, many peculiar influences. It not unfrequently
happens that owing to some great disturbance
of the crust of the earth, a mineral vein is dislocated,
and one part either sinks below, or is lifted above its
original position; the fissures formed between the two
being usually filled in with clay or with crystalline
masses of more recent formation than the fissure itself.
It is frequently found that these “<i>cross courses</i>,” as
they are called in mining language, contain ores of a
different character from those which constitute the
mineral vein; for instance, in them nickel, cobalt, and
silver are not unfrequently discovered. When these
metals are so found, they almost invariably occur between
the ends of the dislocated lode, and often take a
curvilinear direction, as if they were deposited along a
line of electrical force.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>In the laboratory such an arrangement has been
imitated, and in a mass of clay fixed between the galvanic
plates, after a short period a distinct formation of
a mineral vein has taken place.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> By the action, too, of
weak electrical currents, Becquerel, Crosse, and others,
have been successful in imitating nature so far as to
produce crystals of quartz and other minerals. In addition
to this evidence, in support of the electrical theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
of the origin of mineral veins, it can be experimentally
shown that a schistose structure may be given to clays
and sandstone by voltaic action.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>There is often a very remarkable regularity in the
direction of mineral veins: throughout Cornwall, for
instance, they most commonly have a bearing from the
E. of N. to the W. of S. It has hence been inferred
that they observe some relation to the magnetic poles of
the earth. However this may be, it is certain that the
ore in any lodes which are in a direction at right angles,
or nearly so, to this main line, differs in character from
that found in these, so called, east and west lobes.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The sources of chemical action in the earth are numerous.
Water percolating through the soil, and finding
its way to great depths through fissures in the rocks,
carries with it oxygen and various salts in solution.
Water again rising from below, whether infiltrated from
the ocean or derived from other sources, is usually of a
high temperature, and it always contains a large quantity
of saline matter.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> By these causes alone chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
action must be set up. Chemical change cannot take
place without a development of electricity: and it has
been proved that the quantity of electricity required for
the production of any change is equal to that contained
in the substances undergoing such change. Thus a
constant activity is maintained within the caverns of the
rock by the agency of the chemical and electrical
elements, and mutations on a scale of great grandeur
are constantly taking place under some directive force.</p>

<p>The mysterious gnome, labouring&mdash;ever labouring&mdash;in
the formation of metals, and the mischievous Cobalus
of the mine, are the poor creations of superstition. A
vague fear is spread amongst great masses of mankind
relative to the condition of the dark recesses of the
earth; a certain unacknowledged awe is experienced by
many on entering a cavern, or descending a mine: not
the natural fear arising from the peculiarity of the situation,
but the result of a superstitious dread, the effect
of a depraved education, by which they have been taught
to refer everything a little beyond their immediate comprehension
to supernatural causes. The spirit of demon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
worship, as well as that of hero worship, has passed
from the early ages down to the present; and under its
influence the genii of the East and the demons of the
West have preserved their traditionary powers.</p>

<p>Fiction has employed itself with the utmost license in
giving glowing pictures of treasures hidden in the earth’s
recesses. The caverns of Chilminar, the cave of Aladdin,
the abodes of the spirits of the Hartz, and the
dwellings of the fairies of England, are gem-bespangled
and gold-glistening vaults, to which man has never
reached. The pictures are pleasing; but although they
have the elements of poetry in them, and delight the
young mind, they want the sterling character of scientific
truth; and the wonderful researches of the plodding
mineralogist have developed more beauty in the
caverns of the dark rock than ever fancy painted in her
happiest moments.</p>

<p>In all probability the action of the sun’s rays upon
the earth’s surface, producing a constantly varying difference
of temperature, and also the temperature which
has been observed as existing at great depths, give rise
to thermo-electrical currents, which may play an important
part in the results thus briefly described.</p>

<p>In connection with these great natural operations, explaining
them, and being also, to some extent, explained
by them, we have the very beautiful application of electricity
to the deposition of metals, called the Electrotype.</p>

<p>Applying the views we have adopted to this beautiful
discovery,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> the whole process by which these metallic
deposits are produced will be yet more clearly understood.
By the agency of the electric fluid, liberated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
in the galvanic battery, a disturbance of the electricity
of the solution of copper, silver, or gold, is produced,
and the metal is deposited; but, instead of allowing the
acid in combination to escape, it has presented to it
some of the same metal as that revived, and, consequently,
it combines with it, and this compound, being
dissolved, maintains the strength of the solution.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> A
system of revival, or decomposition, is carried on at one
pole, and one of abrasion, or more correctly speaking, of
composition and solution, at the other. By taking
advantage of this very extraordinary power of electricity,
we now form vessels for ornament or use, we gild or
silver all kinds of utensils, and give the imperishability
of metal to the most delicate productions of nature&mdash;her
fruits, her flowers, and her insects;&mdash;and over the
finest labours of the loom we may throw coatings of gold
or silver to add to their elegance and durability. Nor
need we employ the somewhat complex arrangement of
the battery: we may take the steel magnet, and, by
mechanically disturbing the electricity it contains, we
can produce a current through copper wires, which may
be used, and is extensively employed, for gilding and
silvering.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The earth itself may be made the battery,
and, by connecting wires with its mineral deposits, currents
of electricity have been secured, and used for the
production of electrotype deposit.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>The electrotype is but one of the applications of
electricity to the uses of man. This agent has been
employed as the carrier of thought; and with infinite
rapidity, messages of importance, communications involving
life, and intelligences outstripping the speed of
coward crime, have been communicated. There will be
no difficulty in understanding the principle of this,
although many of the nice mechanical arrangements, to
ensure precision, are of a somewhat elaborate character.
The entire action depends on the deflection of a compass-needle
by the passage of an electric current along
its length. If at a given point we place a galvanic battery,
and at twenty or one hundred miles distance from
it a compass-needle, between a wire brought from, and
another returning to the battery, the needle will remain
true to its polar direction so long as the wires are unexcited;
but the moment connection is made, and the
circuit is complete, the electricity of the whole extent of
wire is disturbed, and the needle is thrown at right
angles to the direction of the current. Provided a connection
between two points can be secured, however
remote they are from each other, we thus, almost
instantaneously, convey any intelligence. The effects
of an electric current would appear at a distance of
576,000 miles in a second of time; and to that distance,
and with that speed, it is possible, by Professor
Wheatstone’s beautiful arrangements, to convey whispers
of love or messages of destruction.</p>

<p>The enchanted horse of the Arabian magician, the
magic carpet of the German sorcerer, were poor contrivances,
compared with the copper wires of the electrician,
by which all the difficulties of time and the
barriers of space appear to be overcome. In the Scandinavian
mythology we find certain spiritual powers of
evil enabled to pass with imperceptible speed from one
remote point to another, sowing the seeds of a common
ruin amongst mankind. Such is the morbid creation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
a wild yet highly endowed imagination. The spirit of
evil diffuses itself in a remarkable manner, and, indeed,
we might almost assign to it the power of ubiquity;
but in reality its advance is progressive, and time enters
as an element into any calculation on its diffusion.
Electricity is instantaneous in action; as a spirit of
peace and good-will it can overtake the spirit of evil,
and divert it from its designs. May we not hope that
the electrical telegraph, making, as it must do, the whole
of the civilized world enter into a communion of thought,
and, through thought, of feeling with each other, will
bind us up in one common brotherhood, and that,
instead of misunderstanding and of misinterpreting the
desires and the designs of each other, we shall learn to
know that such things as “natural enemies” do not
exist? To hope to break down the great barrier of
language is perhaps too much; but assuredly we may
hope that, as we must do when closer and more intimate
relations are secured by the aids of science, the barrier
of prejudice may be razed to the ground, and not one
stone left to stand upon another? Our contentions,
our sanguinary wars, consecrated to history by the baptism
of blood, have in every, or in nearly every, instance
sprung from the force of prejudice, or the mistakes of
politicians, whose minds were narrowed to the limits of
a convention formed for perpetuating the reign of
ignorance.</p>

<p>And can anything be more in accordance with the
spirit of all that we revere as holy, than the idea that
the elements employed by the All Infinite in the works
of physical creation shall be made, even in the hands of
man, the ministering angels to the great moral redemption
of the world? Associate the distant nations
of the earth, and they will find some common ground
on which they may unite. Mortality compels a dependence;
and there are charities which spring up alike
in the breast of the savage and the civilized man, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
will not be controlled by the cold usages of pride, but
which, like all truths, though in a still small voice,
speak more forcibly to the heart than errors can, and
serve as links in the great chain which must bind mankind
in a common brotherhood. “None are all evil,”
and the best have much to learn of the amenities of
life from him who yet lives in a “state of nature,” or
rather from him whose sensualities have prevailed over
his intellectual powers, but who still preserves many
of the noblest instincts, to give them no higher term,
which other races, proud of their intelligence, have
thrown aside. Time and space have hitherto prevented
the accomplishment of this; electricity and mechanics
promise to subdue both; and we have every reason to
hope those powers are destined to accelerate the union
of the vast human family.</p>

<p>Electrical power has also been employed for the purpose
of measuring time, and by its means a great number
of clocks can be kept in a state of uniform correctness,
which no other arrangement can effect. A battery being
united with the chief clock, which is itself connected by
wires with any number of clocks arranged at a distance
from each other, has the current continually and regularly
interrupted by the beating of the pendulum, which
interruption is experienced by all the clocks included
in the electric circuit; and, in accordance with this
breaking and making contact, the indicators or hands
move over the dial with a constantly uniform rate.
Instead of a battery the earth itself has supplied the
stream of electric fluid, with which the rate of its revolutions
has been registered with the utmost fidelity.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Electricity, which is now employed to register the
march of time, rushes far in advance of the sage who
walks with measured tread, watching the falling sands
in the hour-glass.</p>

<p>The earth is spanned and the ocean pierced by
the wires of the electric telegraph. Already, from
the banks of the Thames to the shores of the
Adriatic, our electric messenger will do our bidding.
The telegraph is making its way through Italy, and
it is dipping its wires in the Mediterranean, soon to
reach the coast of Africa. They will then run along
the African shores to Egypt and Turkey, and still onward
until they unite with the telegraphs of India, of
which three thousand miles are in progress. From
Hindostan these wondrous wires will run from island to
island in the Indian Archipelago, and thus connect
Australia and New Zealand with Europe.</p>

<p>In a few years we may expect to have an instantaneous
report in London of the extraordinary “nugget” discovered
by some fortunate gold-digger; and the exile
from his native land in the Islands of the South Pacific
Ocean, may learn every hour, if he will, of the doings
of his family and friends in some village home of
England.</p>

piece of shell-lac, whether it be in the form of sheet, or rod, or filament;
but being tough and flexible when cold, as well as soft
when hot, it will serve better than shell-lac in many cases where
the brittleness of the latter is an inconvenience. Thus it makes
very good handles for carriers of electricity in experiments on
induction; not being liable to fracture in the form of thin band or
string, it makes an excellent insulating suspender; a piece of it in
sheet makes a most convenient insulating basis for anything
placed on it. It forms excellent insulating plugs for the stems of
gold-leaf electrometers, when they pass through sheltering tubes,
and larger plugs form good insulating feet for electrical arrangements;
cylinders of it, half an inch or more in diameter, have
great stiffness, and form excellent insulating pillars. In these

<p>
The following deductions have been given by Faraday, in his
<i>Researches in Electricity</i>, a work of most extraordinary merit,
being one of the most perfect examples of fine inductive philosophy
which we possess in the English language:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“All bodies conduct electricity in the same manner from
metals to lacs and gases, but in very different degrees.
</p>
<p>
“Conducting power is in some bodies powerfully increased by
heat, and in others diminished, yet without one perceiving any
accompanying essential electrical difference, either in the bodies,
or in the change occasioned by the electricity conducted.
</p>
<p>
“A numerous class of bodies insulating electricity of low
intensity, when solid, conduct it very freely when fluid, and are
then decomposed by it.
</p>
<p>
“But there are many fluid bodies which do not sensibly conduct
electricity of this low intensity; there are some which
conduct it and are not decomposed; nor is fluidity essential to
decomposition.
</p>
<p>
“There are but two bodies (sulphuret of silver and fluoride
of lead) which, insulating a voltaic current when solid, and conducting
it when fluid, are not decomposed in the latter case.
</p>
<p>
“There is no strict electrical distinction of conduction which
can as yet be drawn between bodies supposed to be elementary,
and those known to be compounds.”</p></div>

philosopher has shown, by the most conclusive experiments,
“that the electricity which decomposes, and that which is evolved
by the decomposition of, a certain quantity of matter, are alike.
What an enormous quantity of electricity, therefore, is required
for the decomposition of a single grain of water! We have
already seen that it must be in quantity sufficient to sustain a
platinum wire 1/104 of an inch in thickness, red hot, in contact
with the air, for three minutes and three quarters. It would
appear that 800,000 charges of a Leyden battery, charged by
thirty turns of a very large and powerful plate machine, in full
action&mdash;a quantity sufficient, if passed at once through the head
of a rat or cat, to have killed it as by a flash of lightning&mdash;are
necessary to supply electricity sufficient to decompose a single

which is naturally associated with the elements of that grain
of water, endowing them with their mutual chemical affinity.”</p></div>

electro-chemical decomposition are carefully stated by Faraday, in
his fifth series of <i>Experimental Researches on Electricity</i>, in which
he thus states his own views:&mdash;“It appears to me that the effect
is produced by an <i>internal corpuscular action</i> exerted according
to the direction of the electric current, and that it is due to a force
either <i>superadded to</i> or <i>giving direction to the ordinary chemical
affinity</i> of the bodies present. The body under decomposition
may be considered as a mass of acting particles, all those which
are included in the course of the electric current contributing to
the final effect; and it is because the ordinary chemical affinity
is relieved, weakened, or partly neutralized by the influence of the
electric current in one direction parallel to the course of the
latter, and strengthened or added to in the opposite direction, that
the combining particles have a tendency to pass in opposite
courses.”</p></div>

law, that, in all the decompositions so effected, the acids and
oxygen become transferred and accumulated around the positive,

voltaic circuit; being transferred in an invisible, and, as it were,
a latent or torpid state, by the action of the electric current,

following extract from the last-quoted of Dr. Philip’s Memoirs,
will give a general view of the conclusions of that eminent physiologist:&mdash;“With
respect to the nature of the powers of the living
animal which we have been considering, the sensorial and muscular
powers, and the powers peculiar to living blood, we have
found belong to the living animal alone, all their peculiar properties
being the properties of life. The functions of life may be
divided into two classes, those which are affected by the properties
of this principle alone, and those, by far the most numerous class,
which result from the co-operation of these properties with those
of the principles which operate in inanimate nature. The nervous
power we have found to be a modification of one of the latter principles,
because it can exist in other textures than those to which
it belongs in the living animal, and we can substitute for it one of
those principles without disturbing the functions of life.
</p>
<p>
“Late discoveries have been gradually evincing how far more
extensive than was supposed, even a few years ago, is the dominion
of electricity. Magnetism, chemical affinity, and (I believe
from the facts stated in the foregoing paper, it will be impossible
to avoid the conclusion) the nervous influence, the leading power
in the vital functions of the animal frame, properly so called, appear
all of them to be modifications of this apparently universal agent;
for I may add we have already some glimpses of its still more extensive
dominion.”

<p class="p2">Agreeably with the view now generally received, that
magnetism and electricity are but modifications of one
force, since they are found to stand to each other in the
relation of cause and effect, the separation which is here
adopted, of the consideration of their several phenomena,
may appear inappropriate. The importance, however,
of all that is connected with magnetism, and the very
decided difference which is presented by true magnetic
action, and that of frictional or chemical electricity, is
so great that it has been thought advantageous to adopt
the present arrangement in reviewing the influence of
terrestrial magnetism with which science has made us
acquainted.</p>

<p>From a very early period a peculiar attractive force
has been observed in some specimens of iron ore.
Masses of this kind were found in Magnesia, and from
that locality we derive the name given to iron in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>
polar condition. This is confirmed by the following
lines by Lucretius:&mdash;</p>

<p>Again we find Pliny employing the term <i>magnetic</i>, to
express this singular power. It was known to the
ancients that the magnetic power of iron, and the
electric property of amber, were not of the same
character, but they were both alike regarded as miraculous.
The Chinese and Arabians seem to have known
Magnetism at a period long before that at which Europeans
became acquainted with either the natural loadstone or
the artificial magnet. Previously to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 121, the
magnet is distinctly mentioned in a Chinese dictionary;
and in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 419 it is stated in another of their books
that ships were steered south by it.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The earliest popularly received account of its use in
Europe is, that Vasco de Gama employed a compass in
1427, when that really adventurous navigator first explored
the Indian seas. It is highly probable, however,
that the knowledge of its important use was derived
from some of the Oriental nations at a much earlier
period.</p>

<p>We have some curious descriptions of the <i>leading
stone</i> or loadstone, in the works of an Icelandic
historian, who wrote in 1068. The mariner’s compass
is described in a French poem of the date of 1181; and
from Torfæus’s History of Norway, it appears to have
been known to the northern nations certainly in 1266.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>We have not to deal with the history of magnetic
discovery, but so far as it tells of the strange properties
which magnets are found to possess, and the
application of this knowledge to the elucidation of
effects occurring in nature.</p>

<p>A brown stone, in no respect presenting anything by
which it shall be distinguished from other rude stones
around it, is found, upon close examination, to possess the
power of drawing light particles of iron towards it. If
this stone is placed upon a table, and iron filings are
thrown lightly around it, we discover that these filings
arrange themselves in symmetric curves, proceeding
from some one point of the mass to some other; and
upon examining into this, we shall find that the iron
which has once clung to the one point will be rejected
by the other. If this stone is freely suspended, we
shall learn also that it always comes to rest in a certain
position,&mdash;this position being determined by these
points, and some attractive force residing in the earth
itself. These points we call its poles; and it is now
established that this rude stone is but a small representative
of our planet. Both are magnetic: both are so
in virtue of the circulation of currents of electricity, or
of lines of magnetic force, as seen in the curves formed
by the iron dust, and the north pole of the one attracts
the south pole of the other, and the contrary. By a
confusion of terms we speak of the north pole of a compass-needle,
meaning that point which is always opposite
to the north pole of the earth: the truth being that
the pole of the compass-needle, which is so forcibly
drawn to the north, is a point in a contrary state, or, as
we may express it, really a south pole.</p>

<p>There is a power of a peculiar kind, differing from
gravitation, or any other attracting or aggregating force
with which we are acquainted, which exists permanently
in the magnetic iron stones, and also in the earth.
What is this power?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>Magnetism may be produced in any bar of steel,
either by rubbing it with a loadstone, or by placing it in
a certain position in relation to the magnetic currents of
the earth, and, by a blow or any other means, disturbing
its molecular arrangement. This principle appears to
involve the iron as with an atmosphere, and to interpenetrate
it. By one magnet we may induce magnetism
in any number of iron bars without its losing any of its
original force. As we have observed of the electrical
forces already considered, the magnet constantly presents
two points in which there is a difference manifested by
the circumstance that they are always drawn with considerable
power towards the north or south poles of the
earth. That this power is of the same character as the
electricity which we have been considering, is now most
satisfactorily proved. By involving a bar of soft iron
which, being without any magnetic power, is incapable
of sustaining even an ounce weight, with a coil of
copper wire, through which a galvanic current is passing,
the bar will receive, by induction from the current, an
enormous accession of power, and will, so long as the
current flows around it, sustain many hundred pounds
weight, which, the moment the current is checked, fall
away from it in obedience to the law of gravity. Thus
the mere flow of this invisible agent around a mass of
metal possessing no magneto-attractive power, at once
imparts this life-like influence to it, and as long as the
current is maintained, the iron is endowed with this
surprising energy.</p>

<p>This discovery, which we owe to the genius of
Oersted, and which has, indeed, given rise to a new
science, electro-magnetism, may be regarded as one of
the most important additions made to our knowledge.</p>

<p>Current electricity is magnetic; iron is not necessary
to the production of magnetic phenomena, although by
its presence we secure a greater amount of power. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span>
copper wires which complete the circuit of a galvanic
battery, will attract and hold up large quantities of iron
filings, and the wires of the electric telegraph will do
the same, while any signal is being conveyed along
them. Again, all the phenomena common to galvanic
electricity can be produced by merely disturbing the
power permanently secured in the ordinary magnet.
It was thought that magnets would become weakened
by this constant disturbance of their magnetism; but,
since its application to the purpose of manufacture, and
magneto-electricity has been employed in electro-plating,
it has been found that continued action for many
years, during which enormous quantities of electricity
have been thus given out and employed in producing
chemical decomposition, has not, in the slightest degree,
altered their powers. Thus a small bar of metal is
shown to be capable of pouring out, for any number of
years, the principle upon which the phenomena of magnetism
depend.</p>

<p>There are, however, differences, and striking ones,
between ordinary and magnetic electricity. In the
magnet we have a power at rest, and in the electrical
machine or galvanic battery, a power in motion.
Ordinary electricity is stopped in its passage by a plate
of glass, of resin, and many other substances; but magnetism
passes these with freedom, and influences magnetic
bodies placed on the other side. It would appear,
though we cannot explain how, that magnetism is due
to some lateral influence of the electric currents. A
magnetic bar is placed over a copper wire, and it hangs
steadily in the direction of its length; an electric current
is passed along it, and the magnet is at once driven to
place itself across the wire. Upon this experiment, in
the main, Ampère founds his theory of terrestrial magnetism.
He supposes electrical currents to be traversing
our globe from east to west, and thus, that the
needle takes its direction, not from the terrestrial action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
of any fixed magnetic poles, but from the repulsion of
these currents, as is the case with the wire.</p>

<p>It has been found that wires, freely suspended, along
which currents were passing in opposite directions,
revolve about each other, or have an inclination to
place themselves at right angles; thus exhibiting the
same phenomenon as the magnet and the conducting
wire. So far the hypothesis of Ampère leads us most
satisfactorily. We see in the magnet one form of
electricity, and in the machine or battery another. But
why should not the electricity of the magnet, electricity
at rest, exhibit the same powers as this force in
motion?</p>

<p>Oersted, whose theory led him to the discovery of the
fact of the magnetic power of an electric current, of the
establishment indeed of the new science&mdash;<span class="smcap">Electro-Magnetism</span>,
regards the phenomena of a current passing
a wire, and its action on a needle, as evidence of two
fluids, positive and negative, traversing in opposite
directions, and mutually attracting and repelling. He
conceives that they pass the wires in a series of spirals;
that in the magnet, by some peculiar property of the
iron, this conflict of the currents is reduced to an equilibrium,
and its power becomes manifested in its attractive
force.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This does not, however, convey a clear idea to
the mind.</p>

<p>It is curious that iron becomes magnetic in a superior
degree to any other metal; that steel retains permanently
any magnetism imparted to it; but that soft
iron rapidly loses its magnetic power. This must be in
virtue of some peculiar arrangement of the molecules,
or some unknown physical condition of the atoms of the
mass, by which a continued influence is retained by the
steel, probably in a state of constant internal circulation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
It has, however, been shown that soft iron, under
certain circumstances, may be made to retain a large
amount of magnetic force.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>If a horse-shoe shaped bar of soft iron is rendered
magnetic by the circulation of an electric current around
it, while its two ends are united by an armature of soft
iron, so that it is capable of supporting many hundred
pounds weight; and we then, by breaking the circuit,
stop the current, taking care the armature is kept in
contact, the iron will not lose its magnetic property,
but will retain this power for many years. If the connecting
piece of iron, the armature, is removed, the bar
immediately loses all its magnetism, and will not support
even the armature itself. This fact appears to confirm
the idea that magnetism is due to the retention of
electricity, and that steel possesses the property of
equalizing the opposing forces, or of binding this
principle to itself like an atmosphere.</p>

<p>The influence of heat on magnetism is so remarkable
a proof of the dependence of this power upon molecular
arrangement, that it must not escape our notice. To
select but one of many experiments by Mr. Barlow, it
was found that in a bar of malleable iron, in which,
when cold, the magnetic effect was + 30° 0', all polarity
ceased at a white heat, that it was scarcely appreciable
at a red heat, but that at a blood-red heat it was equal
to + 41° 0'.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The more closely we examine the peculiarities of the
magnetic power, and particularly as they are presented
to us in its terrestrial action, the more surprising will
its influence appear to be. We have discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
natural cause which certainly exercises a very remarkable
power over matter, and we have advanced so far in
our investigations as to have learnt the secret of converting
one form of force into another, or of giving to a
principle, produced by one agency, a new character
under new conditions; of changing, in fact, electricity
into magnetism, and from magnetism again evolving
many of the effects of electrical currents.</p>

<p>If a magnetic bar is freely suspended above the
earth, it takes, in virtue of some terrestrial power, a
given direction, which is an indication of the earth’s
magnetic force. Whether this is the consequence of
the currents of electricity, which Ampère supposes to
circulate around the globe, from east to west, or the
result of points of attraction in the earth itself, the
phenomenon is equally wonderful. To whatever cause
we may refer the visible effects, it appears certain that
this earth is composed of particles in a magnetic state,
the character varying with physical conditions, and that
terrestrial magnetic force is the collective action of all
the atoms of this planetary mass.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span></p>
<p>The remarkable connexion which has been observed
between the changes in the physical condition of the
surface of the sun and terrestrial phenomena, must not
escape our notice. Sir William Herschel thought he
perceived a link connecting the dark spots on the sun’s
face with the variations of the earth’s temperature.
This has not, however, been confirmed by the observations
which have been made since the time of Herschel.
The careful examinations of the solar spots which have
been made by Schwabe,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> prove a well-defined order of
progress in them. He has discovered that they move in
cycles of ten years&mdash;from the smallest number visible in
a given year, they regularly increase for five years,
when they reach their maximum; they then as regularly
decrease, and at the end of another five years they are
at their maximum number. The magnetic observations
which have been carried on by the British and other
governments for some years, over every part of the
world, have elicited the fact that the order of variation
in the earth’s magnetic intensity is in cycles of ten
years, and the law of increase and decrease which is found
to prevail with the solar spots distinctly marks the variations
of terrestrial magnetism. Few more interesting
facts than this are within the range of our knowledge,
proving as it does the direct dependence of terrestrial
phenomena on solar force.</p>

<p>The constancy with which a magnetised needle points
along a certain line which varies a little from the earth’s
axial line, renders it one of the most important instruments
to the practical and the scientific man. The
wanderer of the ocean or of the desert is enabled,
without fear of error, to pursue his path, and in unknown
regions to determine the azimuth of objects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
The miner or the surveyor finds in the magnetic compass
the surest guide in his labours, and the experiment
is for ever studying its indications.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“True as the needle to the pole,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>has passed into a proverb among mankind, but the
searching inquiry of modern observers has shown that
the expression is correct only with certain limitations.
There are two lines on the surface of the earth along
which the needle points true north, or where the magnetic
and the geographical north correspond. These
are called lines of <i>no variation</i>, or, as they have also
been designated, <i>agonic lines</i>, and one is found in the
eastern and the other in the western hemisphere. The
American line is singularly regular, passing in a south-east
direction from the latitude 60° to the west of Hudson’s
Bay, across the American lakes, till it reaches the
South Atlantic ocean, and cuts the meridian of Greenwich
in about 65° south latitude. The Asiatic line of
<i>no variation</i> is very irregular, owing, without doubt, to
local interferences; it begins below New Holland, in
latitude 60° south, it bends westward across the Indian
ocean, and from Bombay has an inflection eastward
through China, and then northward across the sea of
Japan, till it reaches the latitude of 71° north, when it
descends again southward, with an immense semicircular
bend, which terminates in the White Sea.</p>

<p>Hansteen has thought that there are two points in
each hemisphere which may be regarded as stronger
and weaker poles on opposite sides of the poles of revolution.
These are called the magnetic poles of the
earth, or by Hansteen <i>magnetic points of convergence</i>.
These four points are considered to have a regular
motion round the globe, the two northern ones from
west to east, and the two southern ones from east to
west. By the assistance of recorded observations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
Hansteen has calculated the periods of these revolutions
to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="no">
<li>The weakest north pole in 860 years.</li>
<li>The strongest north pole in 1746 years.</li>
<li>The weakest south pole in 1304 years.</li>
<li>The strongest south pole in 4609 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some points of speculation on which
Hansteen has ventured which have been smiled at as
fanciful; but they may rather indicate an amount of
knowledge in the Brahminical and Egyptian priesthood,
beyond what we are usually disposed to allow them, and
prove that their observations of nature had led them to
an appreciation of some of the most remarkable harmonies
of this mysterious creation.</p>

<p>The above terms are exceedingly near 864, 1246,
1728, 4320, and those numbers are equal to the mystic
number of the Indians, Greeks, and Egyptians, 432
multiplied by 2, 3, 4, and 10. On these the ancients
believed a certain combination of natural events to
depend, and, according to Brahminical mythology, the
duration of the world is divided into four periods, each
of 432,000 years. Again, the sun’s mean distance from
the earth is 216 radii of the sun, and the moon’s mean
distance 216 radii of the moon, each the half of 432.
Proceeding with this very curious examination, Hansteen
says, 60 multiplied by 432 equals 15,920, the
smallest number divisible at once by all the four periods
of magnetic revolution, and hence the shortest time in
which the four poles can complete a cycle, and return to
their present state, and <i>which coincides exactly with the
period in which the precession of the equinoxes will
amount to a complete circle</i>, reckoning the precession at
a degree in seventy-two years.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span></p>
<p>When we consider the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism
carefully, it appears to indicate the action of a
power external to the earth itself, and, as Hansteen
conceives, having its origin from the action of the sun,
heating, illuminating, and producing a magnetic tension,
in the same manner as it produces electrical excitation
and actino-chemical action.</p>

<p>The movements of these magnetic poles have been
the subject of extensive and most accurate observation
in every quarter of the globe. In London, during
1657&ndash;1662, there was no magnetic variation; the agonic
line passing through it. The variation steadily increased,
until, in 1815, it amounted to 24° 15' 17", since which
time it has been slowly diminishing. In addition to
this great variation, we have a regular annual change
dependent on the position of the sun, in reference to the
equinoctial and solstitial points, which was discovered
by Cassini, and investigated by Arago and others.
Also a diurnal variation, which movement appears to
commence early in the morning, moving eastward until
half-past seven, <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when it begins to move westward
until two, <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when it again returns to the east, and in
the course of the night reaches the point from which it
started twenty-four hours before.</p>

<p>We have also remarkable variations in what is
termed the <i>dip</i> of the needle. It is well known that a
piece of unmagnetized steel, if carefully suspended by its
centre, will swing in a perfectly horizontal position, but,
if we magnetize this bar, it will immediately be drawn
downwards at one end. The force of the earth’s
polarity, attracting the dissimilar pole, has caused it to
<i>dip</i>.</p>

<p>There is, in the neighbourhood of the earth’s equator,
and cutting it at four points, an irregular curve, called
the magnetic equator, or <i>aclinic</i> line, where the needle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span>
balances itself horizontally. As we proceed from this
line towards either pole the dip increases, until, at the
north and south poles, the needle takes a vertical
position. The <i>intensity</i> of the earth’s magnetism is
also found to vary with the position, and to increase in
a proportion which corresponds very closely with the
dip. But the <i>intensity</i> is not a function of the dip,
and the lines of equal intensity, <i>isodynamic lines</i>, are not
parallel to those of equal dip. We have already remarked
on the diurnal variation of the declination of
the needle; we know, also, that there exists a regular
monthly and daily change in the magnetic intensity.
The greatest monthly change appears when the earth is
in its perihelion and aphelion, in the months of December
and June,&mdash;a maximum then occurs; and about
the time of the equinoxes a minimum is detected.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The daily variation of intensity is greatest in the
summer, and least in the winter. The magnetism is
generally found to be at a minimum when the sun is
near the meridian; its intensity increasing until about
six o’clock, when it again diminishes.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>What striking evidences all these well-ascertained
facts give of the dependence of terrestrial magnetism on
solar influence! and in further confirmation of this
view, we find a very remarkable coincidence between
the lines of equal temperature&mdash;the isothermal lines,
and those of equal dip and magnetic intensity.</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster first pointed out that there were
in the northern hemisphere two poles of maximum
cold; these poles agree with the magnetic points of
convergence; and the line of maximum heat, which
does not run parallel to the earth’s equator, is nearly
coincident with that of magnetic power. Since See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>beck
has shown us that electrical and magneto-electrical
phenomena can be produced by the action of heat
upon metallic bars, we have, perhaps, approached
towards some faint appreciation of the manner in which
the solar calorific radiations may, acting on the surface
of our planet, produce electrical and magnetic effects.
If we suppose that the sun produces a disturbance of
the earth’s electricity along any given line, in all directions
at right angles to that line, we shall have magnetic
polarity induced.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> That such a disturbance is
regularly produced every time the sun rises, has been
sufficiently proved by many observers.</p>

<p>In 1750, Wargentin noticed that a very remarkable
display of <i>Aurora borealis</i> was the cause of a peculiar
disturbance of the magnetic needle; and Dr. Dalton<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
was the first to show that the luminous rays of the
Aurora are always parallel to the dipping-needle, and
that the Auroral arches cross the magnetic meridian at
right angles. Hansteen and Arago have attended with
particular care to these influences of the northern lights,
and the results of their observations are:&mdash;</p>

<p>That as the crown of the Aurora quits the usual
place, the dipping-needle moves several degrees forward:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the part of the sky where all the beams of the
Aurora unite, is that to which a magnetic needle
directs itself, when suspended by its centre of gravity:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the concentric circles, which show themselves
previously to the luminous beams, rest upon two points
of the horizon equally distant from the magnetic meri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>dian;
and that the most elevated points of each arch
are exactly in this meridian.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear that every Aurora disturbs the
magnetic needle; as Captains Foster and Back both
describe very splendid displays of the phenomenon, which
did not appear to produce any tremor or deviation upon
their instruments.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Some sudden and violent movements have been from
time to time observed to take place in suspended
magnets; and since the establishment of magnetic
observatories in almost every part of the globe, a very
remarkable coincidence in the time of these agitations
has been detected. They are frequently connected with
the appearance of Aurora borealis; but this is not constantly
the case. These disturbances have been called
<i>magnetic storms</i>; and over the Asiatic and European
continent, the islands of the Atlantic and the western
hemisphere, they have been proved to be simultaneous.</p>

<p>From observations made at Petersburg by Kupffer,
and deductions drawn from the observations obtained by
the Magnetic Association, it appears probable that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
<i>storms</i> arise from a sudden displacement in the magnetic
lines of the earth’s surface; but the cause to which this
may be due is still to be sought for.</p>

<p>In the brief and hasty sketch which has been given
of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, enough has
been stated to show the vast importance of this very
remarkable power in the great operations of nature. We
are gradually reducing the immense mass of recorded
observations, and arriving at certain laws which are
found to prevail. Still, the origin of the force, whether
it is strictly electrical, whether it is the circulation of a
magnetic fluid, or whether it is merely a peculiar excitation
of some property of matter, are questions which are
open for investigation.</p>

<p>In the beautiful Aurora borealis, with its trembling
diffusive lights, and its many-coloured rays, we have
what may be regarded as a natural exhibition of magnetism,
and we appear to have within our grasp the explanation
we desire. But we know not the secret of
even these extraordinary meteorological displays. If we
pass an electric spark from a machine through a long
cylinder, exhausted of air as far as possible, we have a
mimic representation of the Northern Lights&mdash;the same
attenuation of brightness, almost dwindling into phosphorescence;
and by the slightest change of temperature
we may produce that play of colours which is
sometimes so remarkably manifested in Aurora. Dr.
Dalton considered Aurora borealis <i>as a magnetic phenomenon,
and that its beams are governed by the earth’s
magnetism</i>. We know that the arc of light produced
between the poles of a powerful galvanic battery is
readily deflected by a good magnet; and we have lately
learned that every vapour obeys the magnetic force.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
It is, therefore, yet a question for our consideration,
does the earth’s magnetism produce the peculiar pheno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>mena
of Aurora by acting upon electricity in a state of
glow? or have we evidence in this display of the circulation
of the magnetic fluid around our globe, manifesting
itself by its action on the ferruginous and other
metallic matter, which Fusinieri has proved to exist in
the upper regions of our atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> That magnetic
radiations do exist, has been proved by Faraday, and
that they form lines of force perpendicular to the earth’s
surface, has been experimentally shown. Parallelograms
of wire moved upon a central axis, and connected with
a galvanometer, give at every revolution indication of an
electric disturbance in all respects analogous to the
production of a current by moving wires in front of a
steel magnet.</p>

<p>The alteration in the properties of heat, when it
passes from the radiant state into combination with
matter, exhibits to us something like what we may suppose
occurs in the conversion of magnetism into electricity
or the contrary. We have a subtile agent, which
evidently is for ever busy in producing the necessary
conditions of change in this our earth: an <span class="correction" title="In the original book: elemeut">element</span> to
which is due the development of many of the most active
powers of nature; performing its part by blending with
those principles which we have already examined;
associating itself with every form of matter; and giving,
as we shall presently see, in all probability, the first
impulses to combination, and regulating the forms of
aggregating particles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>As electricity has the power of altering the physical
conditions of the more adherent states of matter, thus
giving rise to variations of form and modes of combination,
so gross matter appears to alter the character of
this agency, and thus disposes it to the several modifications
under which we have already detected its presence.
We have mechanical electricity and chemical electricity,
each performing its great work in nature; yet both
manifesting conditions so dissimilar, that tedious research
was necessary before they could be declared
identical. Magnetic electricity is a third form; all its
characteristics are unlike the others, and the office it
appears to perform in the laboratory of creation is of a
different order from that of the other states of electrical
force. In the first two we have decomposing and recombining
powers constantly manifested&mdash;in fact, their
influences are always of a chemical character; but in
the last it appears we have only a directive power. It
was thought that evidence had been detected of a
chemical influence in magnetism; it did appear that
sometimes a retarding force was exerted, and often an
accelerating one. This has been again denied, and we
have arrayed in opposition to each other some of the
first names among European experimentalists. The
question is not yet to be regarded as settled; but, from
long and tedious investigation, during which every old
experiment has been repeated, and numerous new ones
tried, we incline to the conclusion that chemical action
is not directly affected by magnetic power. It is highly
probable that magnetism may, by altering the structural
arrangement of the surface, vary the rate of chemical
action; but this requires confirmation.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>There is no substance to be found in nature existing
independently of magnetic power. But it influences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
bodies in different ways: one set acting with relation to
magnetism, like iron, and arranging themselves along
the line of magnetic force,&mdash;these are called magnetic
bodies; another set, of which bismuth may be taken as
the representative, always placing themselves at right
angles to this line,&mdash;these are called <i>diamagnetic
bodies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> This is strikingly shown by means of powerful
electro-magnets; but the magnetism of the earth is
sufficient, under proper care, to exhibit the phenomena.</p>

<p>Every substance in nature is in one or other of these
conditions. The rocks, forming the crust of the earth,
and the minerals which are discovered in them; the
surface soil, which is by nature prepared as the fitting
habitation of the vegetable world, and every tree, shrub,
and herb which finds root therein, with their carbonaceous
matter, in all its states of wood, leaf, flower, and
fruit; the animal kingdom, from the lowest monad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
through the entire series up to man,&mdash;have, all of them,
distinct magnetic or diamagnetic relations.</p>

<p>“It is a curious sight,” says Dr. Faraday, “to see a
piece of wood or of beef, or an apple, or a bottle of water
repelled by a magnet, or, taking the leaf of a tree, and
hanging it up between the poles, to observe it take an
equatorial position. Whether any similar effects occur
in nature among the myriads of forms which, upon all
parts of its surface, are surrounded by air, and are subject
to the action of lines of magnetic force, is a question
which can only be answered by future observation.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>At present, the bodies which are known to exhibit
decided ferro-magnetic properties are the following,
which stand arranged in the order of their intensity:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="no">
<li>Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, Manganese,</li>
<li>Chromium, Cerium, Titanium,</li>
<li>Palladium, Platinum, Osmium.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is interesting to know that there are evidences
that two bodies which, when separate, are not magnetic,
as iron is, become so when combined. Copper and
zinc are both of the diamagnetic class, but many kinds
of brass are discovered to be magnetic.</p>

<p>The salts of the above metals are, to a greater or less
extent, ferro-magnetic, but they may be rendered neutral
by water, which is a diamagnetic body, being repelled
by the magnet. It will be unnecessary, here, to enumerate
the class of bodies which are diamagnetic; indeed,
all not included in the preceding list may be considered
as belonging to that class, with the exception of gases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[Pg 255]</span>
and vapours, which appear to exist, relatively to each
other, sometimes in the one, and sometimes in the other
condition.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>To endeavour to reduce our knowledge of these facts
to some practical explanation, we must bear in mind
that particular spaces around the north and south geographical
poles of the earth, are regarded as circles to
which all the magnetic lines of force converge. Under
circumstances which should prevent any interference
with what is called ferro-magnetic action, all bodies
coming under that class would arrange themselves according
to the laws which would regulate the disposition
of an infinite number of magnets, free to move
within the sphere of each other’s influence. The north
and south pole of one magnetic body would attach itself
to the south and north pole of another, until we had a
line of magnets of any extent; the two ends being in
opposite states, like the magnetic points of convergence
of the earth.</p>

<p>Every body, not ferro-magnetic, places itself across
such a line of magnetic force as we have conceived; and
if the earth were made up of separate layers of ferro-magnetic
and diamagnetic bodies, the result would be
the formation of bands at right angles to each other.
This is not the case, by reason of the intermingling of
the two classes of substances. Out of the known chemical
elements we find only about ten which are actively
ferro-magnetic; the others combining with these give
rise to either a weaker state, a neutral condition, or the
balance of action is turned to the diamagnetic side.
Sulphate of iron, for instance, is a magnetic salt; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[Pg 256]</span>
in solution, water being diamagnetic, it loses its
property. The yellow prussiate of potash dissolved
in water is a diamagnetic body; but the red
prussiate, which contains an atom less of potassium,
is magnetic: but in the solid state they are both
diamagnetic.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>From this it would appear that the chemical composition
of a body regulated its relation to magnetism.
The following facts will show, however, that the molecular
structure is more particularly concerned in determining
the molecular condition of substances.</p>

<p>M. Plücker, being desirous of finding the extent to
which the <i>direction of the fibres</i> in organic bodies might
influence their magnetic or diamagnetic properties, was
led to inquire whether in crystals the direction of the
optic axes, which itself depends upon the arrangement
of the particles, might not also exercise some influence.
The first submitted to the action of the electro-magnet
a thin plate of tourmaline, such as is employed in experiments
upon polarization, having its optic axis parallel to
its longest length. It was very quickly perceived that
the plate was magnetic, by the effect of the iron that it
contains; but it was suspended successively in three
ways,&mdash;first, so that its longest side was vertical, then as
that the shortest side was vertical, and finally so that
the plate itself was horizontal. In the first case it is
directed between the two points of the conical curvatures
of the poles like a magnetic body; but, in the other
two cases, on the contrary, it took the direction assumed
by diamagnetic bodies&mdash;that is to say, a direction such
that its longest length was perpendicular to the line
joining the poles. This direction indicated that the
optical axis was repelled by the two poles, and that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span>
repulsion outweighed the magnetic properties of the
crystal.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The relation of structure to physical phenomena of
essentially different characters is remarkable. Savart,
when making crystalline plates of quartz and carbonate
of lime vibrate, succeeded in determining a relation
between the acoustic figures that are produced in them,
and the particular mode of the crystallization of the
substance. He found that the direction of the optical
axis is constantly connected with that of the principal
forms of the acoustic figures.</p>

<p>Mitscherlich has remarked that crystals do not expand
uniformly by heat, but that this dilatation is greater in
one direction than in another; and that this difference
is connected with their crystalline form. M. de Sénarmont
has shown that conductibility for heat, which is
equal in all directions for the crystals of the regular
system, acquires in others a maximum or a minimum
value, according to directions parallel to the crystallographic
axes; so that the isothermic surfaces, which are
spheres in the former case, are, in the other, ellipsoids
elongated or flattened in the same direction. The optical
axes do not altogether coincide with the principal axes
of conductibility for heat; but this appears to be due
merely to slight differences in the rate of progression,
or the refrangibility of the luminous and calorific rays.</p>

<p><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Wiedmann">Wiedemann</span>, by employing a fine point through which
he made electricity arrive upon a surface that he had
powdered with licopodium or red lead, succeeded in determining,
by means of the form assumed by this light
powder, the conductibility of crystals in different directions.</p>

<p>On a surface of glass, the powder which disperses
itself around the points, in consequence of electric re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>pulsion,
forms a circular figure traversed by radii.
When a plate of gypsum is used instead of glass the
figure is found to be elliptical, and the great axis of the
ellipse forms a right angle with the principal crystallographic
axis, which proves that the electricity distributes
itself more easily in a direction perpendicular to the axis
than in any other. M. <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Wiedmann">Wiedemann</span> comes to the conclusion
that crystals which possess a better conductibility
in the direction of the principal axis, all belong to the
class of negative crystals: while those which have a
better conductibility in the direction perpendicular to
the axis are positive, which indicates that the direction
of best conductibility for electricity is also that according
to which light is propagated relatively with greater
velocity.</p>

<p>Tyndale has shown, that if gutta percha which has
been rendered fibrous in manufacture is cut so that the
fibres are in the direction of this greatest length, or in
a direction perpendicular to this greatest length, and
placed under the influence of a magnet, they direct
themselves equatorially. Ivory cut in the same direction
manifests the same conditions, though both these
substances are diamagnetic.</p>

<p>The fibrous structure, and the planes of cleavage, thus
determine the magnetic condition of a substance. The
special properties presented by crystals, in regard to
the action exercised upon them by magnets, is due to
a particular mode of grouping their particles. This is
also the cause of unequal dilatability, and of unequal
conductibility for heat and for electricity.</p>

<p>How curiously, therefore, does molecular structure
determine the relation of a body to any of the forms of
physical force!</p>

<p>We still search in the dark, and see but dimly the
evidences; yet it becomes almost a certainty to us, that
this stone of granite, with its curious arrangement of
felspar, mica, and quartz, presents its peculiar condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
in virtue of some law of magnetic force. The crystal,
too, of quartz, which we break out of the mass, and
which presents to us a beautifully regular figure, is, beyond
a doubt, so formed, because the atoms of silica are
each one impelled in obedience to one of these two conditions
of magnetism to set themselves in a certain order
to each other, which cannot be altered by human force
without destruction.</p>

<p>All the laws which regulate the forms of crystals and
amorphous bodies are, to the greatest degree, simple.
In nature the end is ever attained by the easiest means;
and the complexity of operation, which appears sometimes
to the observer, is only so because he cannot see
the spring by which the machine is moved.</p>

<p>The gaseous envelope, our atmosphere, is in a neutral
state. Oxygen is strikingly magnetic in relation to
hydrogen gas, whilst nitrogen is as singularly the contrary;
and the same contrasts present themselves when
these gases are examined in their relation to common
air. Thus, oxygen being magnetic, and nitrogen the
contrary, we have an equilibrium established, and the
result is a compound neutral in its relations to all
matter. All gases and vapours are found to be diamagnetic,
but in different degrees.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> This is shown by
passing a stream of the gas, rendered visible by a little
smoke, within the influence of a powerful magnet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span></p>
<p>These bodies are, however, found relatively to each
other,&mdash;or even to themselves, under different thermic
conditions,&mdash;to change their states, and pass from the
magnetic to the diamagnetic class. Heat has a very
remarkable influence in altering these relations; and
atmospheric air at one temperature is magnetic to the
same fluid at another: thus, by thermic variations,
attraction or repulsion may be alternately maintained.
By this it must be understood that a stream of air, at a
temperature elevated but a few degrees above that of an
atmosphere of the same kind into which it is passing, is
deflected in one way by a magnet; whereas, if the
stream is colder than the bulk through which it flows,
it is bent in another way by the same force. In
this respect magnetism and diamagnetism show equally
the influence of another physical force, heat; and
we may safely refer many meteorological phenomena
to similar alterations of condition in the atmosphere,
relative to the magnetic relations of the aërial currents.</p>

<p>That magnetism has a directive power is satisfactorily
shown by the formation of crystals in the neighbourhood
of the poles of powerful magnets. The common iron
salt, the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: proto-sulphate">protosulphate</span>, ordinarily crystallizes so that
the crystals unite by their faces; but when crystallizing
under magnetic influence, they have a tendency to
arrange themselves with regard to each other so that
the acute angle of one crystal unites with one of the
faces of another crystal, near to, but never actually at,
its obtuse angle. In addition to this, if a magnet of
sufficient power is employed, the crystals arrange themselves
in magnetic curves from one pole to the other, a
larger crop of crystals being always formed at the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span>
than at the south pole. Here we have evidence of an
actual turning round of the crystal, in obedience to the
directive force of the magnet; and we have the curious
circumstance of a difference in some way, which is not
clearly explained, between the two opposite poles. If,
instead of an iron or a ferro-magnetic salt, we employ
one which belongs to the other, or diamagnetic, class,
we have a curious difference in the result. If into a
glass dish, fixed on the poles of a strong electro-magnet,
we pour a quantity of a solution of nitrate of silver, and
place in the fluid, over the poles of the magnet, two
globules of mercury (an arrangement by which that
arborescent crystallization, called the <i>Arbor Dianæ</i>, is
produced,) we have the long needle-shaped crystals of
silver, arranging themselves in curves which would cut
the ordinary magnetic lines at right angles.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>In the first example given we have an exhibition of
magnetic force, while in the last we have a striking
display of the diamagnetic power.</p>

<p>The large majority of natural formations appear to
group themselves under the class of diamagnetics.
These bodies are thought to possess poles of mutual
repulsion among themselves, and which are equally
repelled by the magnetic points of convergence. Confining
our ideas to single particles in one condition or
the other, we shall, to a certain extent, comprehend the
manifold results which must arise from the exercise of
these two modes of force. At present, our knowledge
of the laws of magnetism is too limited to allow of our
making any general deductions relative to the disposition
of the molecules of matter; and the amount of
observation which has been given to the great natural
arrangements, is too confined to enable us to infer more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
than that it is probable many of the structural conditions
of our planet are due to polarity.</p>

<p>Mountain ranges observe a singular uniformity of
direction, and the cleavage planes of rock are evidently
determined by some all-pervading power. Mineral
bodies are not distributed in all rocks indiscriminately.
The primary formations hold one class of metalliferous
ores, and the more recent ones another. This is not
to be regarded as in any way connected with their
respective ages, but with some peculiar condition of
the stone itself. The granite and slate rocks, at their
junctions, present the required conditions for the deposit
of copper ore, while we find the limestones have
the characteristic physical state for accumulating lead
ore. Again, on examining any mineral vein, it will be
at once apparent that every particle of ore, and every crystal
of quartz or limestone, is disposed in a direction which
indicates the exercise of some powerful directive agency.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>It appears, from all the results hitherto obtained, that
the magnetic and diamagnetic condition of bodies is
equally due to some peculiar property of matter in relation
to the other forms of electricity. We have not
yet arrived at the connecting link, but it does not appear
to be far distant.</p>

<p>We have already referred to the statement made by
talented experimentalists, that magnetism has a powerful
influence in either retarding or accelerating chemical
combination. Beyond a doubt chemical action weakens
the power of a magnet; but the disturbance which it
occasions in soft iron, on the contrary, appears to tend
to its receiving magnetism more readily, and retaining
it more permanently. Further investigations are, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>ever,
required, before we can decide satisfactorily either
of these problems, both of which bear very strongly
upon the subject we have just been considering.</p>

<p>We have seen that heat and electricity act strangely on
magnetic force, and that this statical power reacts upon
them: and thus the question naturally arises, Do light
and magnetism in any way act upon each other?</p>

<p>Morichini and Carpi on the continent, and Mrs.
Somerville in England, have stated that small bars of
steel can be rendered magnetic by exposing them to
the influence of the violet rays of light. These results
have been denied by others, but again repeated and
apparently confirmed. In all probability, the rays to
which the needles were exposed, being those in which
the maximum actinic power is found, produced an
actual chemical change; and then, if the position were
favourable, it is quite evident that magnetism would be
imparted. Indeed we have found this to be the case
when the needles, exposed to solar radiations, were placed
in the direction of the dip. The supposed magnetization
of light by Faraday has already been mentioned. If
the influence in one case is determined, it will render
the other more probable.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>“In seeking for a cause,” writes Sir David Brewster,
“which is capable of inducing magnetism on the ferruginous
matter of our globe, whether we place it within
the earth, or in its atmosphere, we are limited to the
<span class="smcap">sun</span>, to which all the magnetic phenomena have a distinct
reference; but, whether it acts by its heat, or by
its light, or by specific rays, or influences of a magnetic
nature, must be left to future inquiry.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span></p>
<p>We have learnt that magnetism is not limited to ferruginous
matter; we know that the ancient doctrine of
the universality of the property is true. Kircher, in
his strange work on Magnetism, published in the early
part of the seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>&mdash;a curious exemplification
of the most unwearying industry and careful
experiment, combined with the influences of the credulity
and superstitions of his age&mdash;attributes to this power
nearly all the cosmical phenomena with which, in his
time, men were acquainted. He curiously anticipates
the use of the supposed virtue of magnetic traction
in the curative art; and as the titles of his concluding
chapters sufficiently show, he was a firm believer
in animal magnetism.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> But it is not with
any reference to these that we refer to the work of
<i>Athanasii Kircheri, Societatis Jesu, Magnes, sive de
Magnetivâ Arte</i>, but to show that two hundred years
since, man was near a great truth; but the time of its
development being not yet come, it was allowed to sleep
for more than two centuries, and the shadow of night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
had covered it. In speaking of the vegetable world,
and the remarkable processes by which the leaf, the
flower, and the fruit are produced, this sage brings forward
the fact of the diamagnetic character of the plant,
which has been, within the last two years, re-discovered;
and he refers the motions of the Sun-flower, the closing
of the Convolvulus, and the directions of the spiral,
formed by twining plants, to this particular influence.</p>

<p>This does not appear as a mere speculation, a random
guess, but is the result of deductions from experiment
and observation. Kircher doubtless leaped over a wide
space to come to his conclusion; but the result is valuable
in a twofold sense. In the first it shows us that,
by neglecting a fact which is suggestive, we probably
lose a truth of great general application; and secondly,
it proves to us, that by stepping beyond the point to
which inductive logic leads, and venturing on the wide
sea of hypothesis, we are liable to sacrifice the true to
the false, and thus to hinder the progress of human
knowledge.</p>

<p>Magnetism, in one or other of its forms, is now proved
to be universal, and to its power we are disposed to refer
the structural conditions of all material bodies, both
organic and inorganic. This view has scarcely yet been
recognised by philosophers; but as we find a certain
law of polarity prevailing through every atom of created
matter, in whatever state it may be presented to our
senses, it is evident that every particle must have a polar
and directing influence upon the mass, and every coherent
mass becomes thus only a larger and more
powerful representative of the magnetic unit. Thus we
see the speculation of Hansteen, that the sun is, to us,
a magnetic centre, and that it is equally influenced by
the remoter suns of the universe,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> is supported by
legitimate deductions from experiment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span></p>
<p>The great difficulty is not, however, got rid of by
this speculation; the cause by which the earth’s magnetism
is induced is only removed further off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>The idea of a magnetic fluid is scarcely tenable; and
the ferruginous nature of the Aurora borealis receives
no proof from any investigation; indeed, we have procured
evidence to show that iron is not at all necessary for
the production of magnetic phenomena. The leaf of a
tree, a flower, fruit, a piece of animal muscle, glass, paper,
and a variety of similar substances, have the power of
repelling the bar of iron which we call a magnet, and
of placing it at right angles to the direction of the force
exerted by them. This is a point which must be constantly
borne in mind when we now consider the
mysteries of magnetic phenomena.</p>

<p>Any two masses of matter act upon each other
according to this law, and although by the power of
cohesion the force may be brought to an equilibrium, or
to its zero point, it is never lost, and may be readily and
rapidly manifested by any of the means employed for
electrical excitation.</p>

<p>Reasoning by analogy, the question fairly suggests
itself: If two systems of inorganic atomic constitution
are thus invested with a power of influencing each other
through a distance, why may not two more highly
developed organic systems equally, or to a greater extent,
produce an influence in like manner? Upon such
reasoning as this is founded the phenomenon known as
Animal Magnetism. There is no denying the fact that
one mass of blood, muscle, nerves, and bone, must,
magnetically, influence another similar mass. This is,
however, something totally different from that abnormal
condition which is produced through some peculiar and,
as yet, unexplained physiological influences.</p>

<p>With the mysterious operations of vital action, the
forces which we have been considering have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
whatever in common. The powers which are employed
in the arrangements of matter are, notwithstanding their
subtile character, of far too gross a nature to influence
the psychological mysteries which present themselves to
the observant mind. It cannot be denied that, by
placing a person of even moderate nervous sensibility
in a constrained position, and under an unnatural
influence of the mind, as acquired by the disciples of
Mesmer, a torpor affecting only certain senses is produced.
The recognised and undoubted phenomena are
in the highest degree curious&mdash;but in these the marvels
of charlatanry and ignorance are not included;&mdash;and
the explanation must be sought for by the physiologist
among those hidden principles upon which depends all
human sensation.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Man, like a magician, stands upon a promontory, and
surveying the great ocean of the physical forces which
involve the material creation, and produce that infinite
variety of phenomena which is unceasingly exhibited
around him, he extends the wand of intelligence, and
bids the “spirits of the vasty deep” obey his evocation.</p>

<p>The phenomena recur&mdash;the great processes of creation
go on&mdash;the external manifestations of omnipotent
power proceed&mdash;effects are again and again produced;
but the current of force passes undulating onwards;&mdash;and
to the proud bidding of the evocator there is no
reply but the echo of his own vain voice, which is lost at
last in the vast immensity of the unknown which lies
beyond him.</p>

<p>We see how powerfully the physical forces, in their
various modes of action, stir and animate this planetary
mass; and amongst these the influence of magnetism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
appears as a great directing agent, though its origin is
unknown to us.</p>

terrestrial magnetic force is the collective action of all the magnetised
particles of the earth’s mass. We represent to ourselves magnetisation
as the separation of the magnetic fluids. Admitting
the representation, the mode of action of the fluids (repulsion of
similar, and attraction of dissimilar, particles inversely as the
square of the distance) belongs to the number of established
truths. No alteration in the results would be caused by changing
this mode of representation for that of Ampère, whereby, instead
of magnetic fluids, magnetism is held to consist in constant galvanic
currents in the minutest particles of bodies. Nor would it
occasion a difference if the terrestrial magnetism were ascribed to
a mixed origin, as proceeding partly from the separation of the
magnetic fluids in the earth, and partly from galvanic currents,
in the same; inasmuch as it is known that for each galvanic
current may be substituted such a given distribution of the magnetic
fluids in a surface bounded by the current, as would exercise
in each point of external space precisely the same magnetic action

by motion, and even tinged with a dullish red and a yellow in a
clear blue sky, seldom produced any sensible change, beyond, at
the most, a tremulous motion. A dense haze or fog, in conjunction
with an active Aurora, seemed uniformly favourable to the
disturbance of the needle, and a low temperature was favourable
to brilliant and active coruscations. On no occasion during two
winters was any sound heard to accompany the motions. The
Aurora was frequently seen at twilight, and as often to the eastward
as to the westward; clouds, also, were often perceived in
the day-time, in form and disposition very much resembling the
Aurora.”&mdash;<i>Narrative of the Arctic Land Expedition.</i></p></div>

called <i>magnetic bodies</i>. Those which are, on the contrary, repelled
by the same power, are termed <i>diamagnetic bodies</i>. On these Dr.
Faraday remarks:&mdash;“Of the substances which compose the crust
of the earth, by far the greater portion belong to the diamagnetic
class; and though ferruginous and other magnetic matters, being
more energetic in their action, are more striking in their phenomena,
we should be hasty in assuming that, therefore, they over
rule entirely the effect of the former bodies. As regards the ocean,
lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere, they will exert their peculiar
effect almost uninfluenced by any magnetic matter in them, and
as respects the rocks and mountains, their diamagnetic influence
is perhaps greater than might be anticipated. I mentioned that
by adjusting water and a salt of iron together, I obtained a solution
inactive in air; that is, by a due association of the forces of a body,
from each class, water and a salt of iron, the magnetic force of the
latter was entirely counteracted by the diamagnetic force of the
former, and the mixture was neither attracted nor repelled: To
produce this effect, it required that more than 48·6 grains of crystallised
protosulphate of iron should be added to ten cubic inches
of water (for these proportions gave a solution which would set
equatorially), a quantity so large, that I was greatly astonished on
observing the power of the water to overcome it. It is not, therefore,
at all unlikely that many of the masses which form the crust
of this our globe, may have an excess of diamagnetic power, and
act accordingly.”&mdash;<i>On new magnetic actions, and on the magnetic

Nitrogen being acted on was manifestly diamagnetic in relation

clearly and even strongly diamagnetic. Its diamagnetic state shows,
in a striking point of view, that gases, like solids, have peculiar
and distinctive degrees of diamagnetic force. Carbonic acid gas
is diamagnetic in air. Carbonic oxide was carefully freed from
carbonic acid before it was used, and it appears to be more diamagnetic
than carbonic acid. Nitrous oxide was moderately, but
clearly, diamagnetic in air. Olefiant gas was diamagnetic. The
coal gas of London is very well diamagnetic, and gives exceedingly
good and distinct results. Sulphurous acid gas is diamagnetic
in air. Muriatic acid gas was decidedly diamagnetic in air.&mdash;<i>On

origin in the sun, the source of all living activity, and our conjecture
gains probability from the preceding remarks on the
daily oscillations of the needle. Upon this principle the sun
may be conceived as possessing one or more magnetic axes,
which, by distributing the force, occasion a magnetic difference
in the earth, in the moon, and all those planets whose
internal structure admits of such a difference. Yet, allowing
all this, the main difficulty seems not to be overcome, but
merely removed from the eyes to a greater distance; for the
question may still be asked, with equal justice, whence did
the sun acquire its magnetic force? And if from the sun we
have recourse to a central sun, and from that again to a general
magnetic direction throughout the universe, having the Milky
Way for its equator, we but lengthen an unrestricted chain,
every link of which hangs on the preceding link, no one of
them on a point of support. All things considered, the following
mode of representing the subject appears to me most
plausible. If a single globe were left to move alone freely in the
immensity of space, the opposite forces existing in its material
structure would soon arrive at an equilibrium conformable to their
nature, if they were not so at first, and all activity would soon
come to an end. But if we imagine another globe to be introduced,
a mutual relation will arise between the two; and one of its
results will be a reciprocal tendency to unite, which is designated
and sometimes thought to be explained by the merely descriptive
word Attraction. Now would this tendency be the only consequence
of this relation? Is it not more likely that the fundamental
forces, being drawn from their state of indifference or rest,
would exhibit their energy in all possible directions, giving rise to
all kinds of contrary action? The electric force is excited, not by
friction alone, but also by contact, and probably also, though in
smaller degrees, by the mutual action of two bodies at a distance;
for contact is nothing but the smallest possible distance, and that,
moreover, only for a few small particles. Is it not conceivable
that magnetic force may likewise originate in a similar manner?
When the natural philosopher and the mathematician pay regard
to no other effect of the reciprocal relation between two bodies at
a distance, except the tendency to unite, they proceed logically, if
their investigations require nothing more than a moving power;
but should it be maintained that no other energy can be developed
between two such bodies, the assertion will need proof and the
proof will be hard to find.”&mdash;The above is a translation from
Hansteen’s work <i>On Magnetism</i>.</p></div>

<p class="p2">All things on the earth are the result of chemical combination.
The operations by which the commingling of
molecules and the interchange of atoms take place, we
can imitate in our laboratories; but in nature they
proceed by slow degrees, and, in general, in our hands
they are distinguished by suddenness of action. In
nature chemical power is distributed over a long period
of time, and the process of change is scarcely to be
observed. By art we concentrate chemical force, and
expend it in producing a change which occupies but a
few hours at most. Many of the more striking phenomena
of nature are still mysterious to us, and principally
because we do not, or cannot, take the element time
into calculation. The geologist is compelled to do this
to explain the progress of the formation of the crust of
the earth, but the chemist rarely regards the effects of
time in any of his operations. The chemical change
which within the fissure of the rock is slowly and
silently at work, displacing one element or molecule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
and replacing it by another, is in all probability the
operation of a truly geological period. Many, however,
of the changes which are constantly going on around us,
are of a much more rapid character, and in these nature
is no slower in manipulating than the chemist.</p>

<p>Had it been that the elements which are now found
in combination could exist in a free state, the most
disastrous consequences would necessarily ensue. There
must have been a period when many of the combinations
known to us were not yet created. Their elements
either existed in other forms, or were uncombined.
Our rocks are compounds of oxygen with certain peculiar
metals which unite with oxygen so rapidly that
incandescence is produced by their combination. Let us
suppose that any of these metals existed in purity, and
that they were suddenly brought into contact with
water, the atmospheric air, or any body containing
oxygen, the result would be a convulsion of the most
fearful kind; the entire mass of metal would glow with
intensity of heat, and the impetuosity of the action would
only be subdued when the whole of the metal had
become oxidized. Volcanic action has been referred to
some such cause as this, but there is not sufficient
evidence to support the hypothesis; indeed, it is contrary
to the opinion of most philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Such a
condition may possibly have existed at one time, during
that period when darkness was upon the face of the
deep, when the earth was a chaos; but it is only adduced
here as an example of the violent nature of some
chemical changes. Potassium thrown on water bursts
into flame, and sodium does so under certain conditions.
If these, or the metals proper in a state of fine division,
are brought into an atmosphere of chlorine, the intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span>
of chemical action is so great that they become incandescent,
many of them glowing with extreme brilliancy.
If hydrogen gas is mixed with this element (chlorine)
they unite, under the influence of light, with explosive
violence, giving rise to a compound, muriatic acid, which
combines with water in an almost equally energetic
manner. Nitrogen, as it exists in the atmosphere,
mixed with oxygen, appears nearly inert; with hydrogen
it forms the pungent compound, ammonia; with carbon,
the poisonous one, cyanogen, the base of prussic acid;
with chlorine it gives rise to a fluid, oily in its appearance,
but which, when merely touched by an unctuous body,
explodes more violently than any other known compound,
shivering whatever vessel it may be contained in,
to atoms; with iodine it is only slightly less violent;
and in certain combinations with silver, mercury, gold,
or platinum, it produces fulminating compounds of the
most dangerous character.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Here we have elements
harmless when uncombined, exhibiting the most destructive
effects if their combinations are at all disturbed;
and in the other case we have inert masses produced
from active and injurious agents.</p>

<p>We regard a certain number of substances as <i>elementary</i>;
that is to say, not being able, in the present
state of our knowledge, to reduce them to any more
simple condition, they are considered as the elements
which by combination produce the variety of substances
found in the three kingdoms of nature.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the atomic constitution of
bodies. It remains now to explain the simplicity and
beauty which mark every variety of combination under
chemical force. As a prominent and striking example,
water is a compound of two gaseous bodies, oxygen and
hydrogen:&mdash;</p>

<p>If we decompose water by means of galvanic elec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>tricity,
or determine its composition by direct chemical
analysis, we shall find it consists of two volumes of hydrogen
gas, united to one volume of oxygen, or, by weight, of
one part of hydrogen combined with eight of oxygen.
In 100 parts, therefore, we should find&mdash;</p>

<table summary="chemical analysis of water">
<tr><td>Oxygen</td><td class="tdpad">88·9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hydrogen</td><td class="tdpad">11·0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It is found in the same way that the theoretical weight
of the atom of carbon is 6, and that of nitrogen 14;
whilst the atom of iron is 28, that of silver 108, of gold
199, and that of platinum and iridium each 98.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Now,
as these are the relative weights of the ultimate indivisible
atom, it follows that all combinations must be
either atom to atom, or one to two, three, or four; but
that in no case should combination take place in any
other than a multiple proportion of the equivalent or
atomic number. This is found to be the case. Oxygen,
for instance, combines as one, two, or three
atoms; its combination presenting some multiple of its
equivalent number 8, as 16, or 24: and in like manner
the combining quantity of carbon is 6, or some multiple
of that number. Where this law is not found strictly
to agree with analytical results, of which some examples
are afforded by the sesquioxides, it may be
attributed, without doubt, to some error of analysis or
in the method of calculation.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more perfect than the manner in
which nature regulates the order of combination. We
have no uncertain arrangement; but, however great the
number of the atoms of one element may be, over those
of another, those only combine which are required,
according to this great natural law, to form the compound,
all the others still remaining free and uncom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>bined.
These results certainly appear to prove that the
elementary particles of matter are not of the same
specific gravities. Do they not also indicate that any
alteration in the specific gravity of the atom would give
rise to a new series of compounds, thus apparently producing
a new element? Surely there is nothing
irrational in the idea that the influences of heat or
electricity, or of other powers of which as yet we know
nothing, may be sufficient to effect such changes in the
atomic constituents of this earth.</p>

<p>The combination of elementary atoms takes place
under the influence of an unknown force which we are
compelled to express by a figurative term, <i>affinity</i>.
In some cases it would appear that the disposition of
two bodies to unite, is determined by the electrical condition;
but a closer examination of the question than
it is possible to enter into in this place, clearly shows
that some physical state, not electrical, influences combining
power.</p>

<p>Chemical affinity or attraction is the peculiar disposition
which one body has to unite with another. To
give some instances in illustration. Water and spirit
combine most readily: they have a strong affinity for
each other. Water and oil repel each other: they have
no affinity; they will not enter into combination. If
carbonate of potash is added to the spirit and water in
sufficient quantity, the water is entirely separated, and
the pure spirit will float over the hydrated potash. If
potash is added to the oil and water, it combines with
the oil, and, forming soap, they all unite together; but,
if we now add a little acid to the mixture, the potash
will quit the oil to combine with the acid, and the oil
will be repelled as before and float on the liquid. This
has been called single elective affinity. These elections
were regarded as constant, and chemists drew up tables
for the purpose of showing the order in which these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
decompositions occur.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Thus, ammonia, it was shown,
would separate sulphuric acid from magnesia, lime
remove it from ammonia, potash or soda from lime, and
barytes from potash or soda. It was thought the
inverse of this order would not take place, but recent
researches have shown that the results are modified by
quantity and some other conditions.</p>

<p>It often happens that we have a compound action of
this kind in which double election is indicated. Sulphate
of lime and carbonate of ammonia in solution are
brought together, and there result a carbonate of lime
and a sulphate of ammonia. Now, in such cases
nothing more than single elective attraction most
probably occurs, and the carbonic acid is seized by the
lime, by the great affinity of that earth for carbonic
acid, only after it has been set free from the ammonia,
and then, by the force of cohesion acting with the combining
powers, the insoluble salt is precipitated.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> There
is a curious fact in connection with this decomposition.
If carbonate of lime and sulphate of ammonia are mixed
together dry, and exposed, in a closed vessel, to a red
heat, sulphate of lime and carbonate of ammonia are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
formed. These opposite effects are not very easily explained.
The action of heat is to set free the carbonic
acid; and it can only be by supposing that considerable
differences of temperature reverse the laws of affinity,
that we can at all understand this phenomenon. That
different effects result at high temperatures from those
which prevail at low ones, recent experiments prove to
us, particularly those of Boutigny, already quoted when
considering decomposition by calorific action.</p>

<p>Under the term chemical affinity, which we regard as
a power acting at insensible distances, and producing a
change in bodies, we are content to allow ourselves to
believe that we have explained the great operations of
nature. We find that the vegetable and animal kingdoms
are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen. The granite mountains of the earth, and its
limestone hills, and all its other geological formations,
are found to be metals and oxygen, and carbon and
sulphur, disposed to settle in harmonious union in their
proper places by chemical affinity. But what really is
the power which combines atom to atom, and unites
molecule to molecule? Can we refer the process to
heat? The influence of caloric, although by changing
the form of bodies it sometimes assists combination, is
to be regarded rather as in antagonism to the power of
cohesion. Can it be thought that electricity is active in
producing the result? During every change of state,
those phenomena which we term electrical are manifested;
but we thereby only prove the general diffusion
of the electric principle, and by no means show that
electricity is the cause of the chemical change. Can
light determine these <span class="correction" title="In the original book: change">changes</span>? It is evident, although
light may be a disturbing power, that it cannot be the
effective one; for many of these decompositions and recompositions
are constantly going on within the dark
and silent depths of the earth, to which a sunbeam
cannot reach. That the excitation on the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
earth, produced by solar influence, may modify those
changes, is probable. It is, however, certain that we
must regard all manifestations of chemical force as
dependent upon some secret principles common to all
matter, diffused throughout the universe, but modified
by the influences of the known imponderable elements,
and by the mechanical force of aggregative attraction.</p>

<p>Bodies undergo remarkable changes of form, and
present very different characters, by reactions, which
are of several kinds. We suppose that a permanent
corpuscular arrangement is maintained so long as the
equilibrium of the molecular forces is undisturbed.
Water, for instance, remains unchanged so long as the
balance of affinity is kept up between the oxygen and
hydrogen of which it is composed, or so long as the
oscillations of force between these combining elements
are equal; but disturb this force, or set up a new
vibratory action, as by passing an electric current
through the water, or by presenting another body, which
has the power of reacting upon one of these corpuscular
systems, and the water is decomposed, the hydrogen and
oxygen gases being set free, or one alone is liberated,
and the other combined with the molecules of the agent
employed, and a new compound produced. This is
chemistry, by which science we discover all the combinations
of matter.</p>

<p>Having reason to conclude that atom combines with
atom, according to a system most harmoniously arranged,
there can be no difficulty in conceiving that molecule
unites with molecule, in a manner regulated by some
equally well-marked law. It was, indeed, a discovery
by Wenzel, of Fribourg, that, in salts which decompose
each other, the acid which saturates one base will also
saturate the other base; and the subsequent observations
of Richter, of Berlin, who attached proportional numbers
to the acids and bases, and who remarked that the
neutrality of metallic salts does not change during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>
precipitation of metals by each other, which led the way
to the atomic theory of Dr. Dalton, to whom entirely
belongs the observation, that the equivalent of a compound
body is the sum of the equivalents of its constituents,
and the discovery of combination in multiple
proportions.</p>

<p>The elements of a molecule can take a new arrangement
amongst themselves, without any alteration in the
number of the atoms or of their weight, and thus give
rise to a body of a different form and colour, although
possessing the same chemical constitution. This is the
case with many of the organic compounds of carbon and
hydrogen.</p>

<p>The elements of a compound may be disassociated,
and thus the dissimilar substances of which it is composed
set free. A piece of chalk exposed to heat is, by
the disturbance of its molecular arrangement, changed
in its nature; a gaseous body, carbonic acid, is liberated,
and quick-lime (oxide of calcium) is left behind. If
this carbonic acid is passed through red-hot metal tubes,
or brought in contact with heated potassium, it is resolved
into oxygen and charcoal&mdash;the oxygen combining
with the metal employed. The oxide of calcium
(lime), if subjected to the action of a powerful galvanic
current, is converted into oxygen and a metal, calcium.
Thus we learn that chalk is a body consisting of two
compound molecules,&mdash;carbonic acid, which is formed
by the combination of an atom of carbon with two atoms
of oxygen,&mdash;and lime, which results from the union of
an atom of calcium with one of oxygen.</p>

<p>The condition requisite to the production of chemical
action between bodies is that they should be dissimilar.
Two elementary atoms are placed within the spheres of
each other’s influences, and a compound molecule
results. Oxygen and hydrogen form water; oxygen
and carbon give rise to carbonic acid; nitrogen and
hydrogen unite to form ammonia; and chlorine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
hydrogen to produce hydrochloric acid. In all these
cases an external force is required to bring the atoms
within the range of mutual affinity: flame,&mdash;the electrical
spark,&mdash;actinism,&mdash;or the interposition of a third body,
is necessary in each case. There are other examples in
which no such influence is required. Potassium and
oxygen instantly unite: chlorine, iodine, and bromine
immediately, and with much violence, combine with the
metals to form chlorides, iodides, or bromides.</p>

<p>With compound molecules the action is in many
cases equally active, and combination is readily effected,
as in the cases of the acids and the oxides of some
metals, which are all instances of the most common
chemical attraction.</p>

<p>An elementary or simple molecule and molecules of a
compound and different constitution are brought
together, and a new compound results from an interchange
of their atoms, whilst an element is liberated.
These are essentially illustrations of analytical chemistry.
Sulphuretted hydrogen is mixed with chlorine;
the chlorine combines with the hydrogen, and sulphur
is set free. Potassium is put into water, and it combines
with the oxygen of the water, whilst the hydrogen
is liberated.</p>

<p>Two compound molecules being brought together
may decompose each other, and form two new compounds
by an interchange of their elements.</p>

<p>One element may be substituted for another under
certain circumstances. Gold may be replaced by
mercury; copper will take the place of silver; and iron
will occasion the separation of copper from its solutions,
the iron itself being dissolved to supply its place;
chlorine will substitute hydrogen in the carburetted
hydrogen gases; and many other examples might be
adduced.</p>

<p>Chemical phenomena very frequently become of a
complex character; and one, two, or three of these cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
may be occurring at the same time in the decomposition
of one compound by another. Such are the general
features of chemical science. Many peculiarities and
remarkable phenomena connected with chemical investigations
will be named, as the examination of the elementary
composition of matter is proceeded with; but,
although the philosophy of chemical action is of the
highest interest, it must not be allowed to detain us
with its details, which are, indeed, more in accordance
with a treatise on the science than one which professes
to do no more than sketch out those prevailing and
striking features which, whilst they elucidate the great
truths of nature, are capable of being employed as suggestive
examples of the tendency of scientific investigation
to enlarge the boundaries of thought, and give a
greater elevation to the mind, leading us from the
merely mechanical process of analysis up to the great
synthetical operations, by which all that is found upon
the earth for its ornament, or our necessities, is created.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable phenomena within the
range of physical chemistry are those of <i>Catalysis</i>, or, as
it has also been called, the “<i>Action of presence</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
There are a certain number of bodies known to possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
the power of resolving compounds into new forms,
without undergoing any change themselves. Kirchoff
discovered that the presence of an acid, at a certain
temperature, converted starch into sugar and gum, no
combination with the acid taking place. Thenard found
that manganese, platinum, gold, and silver, and, indeed,
almost any solid organic body, had the power of decomposing
the binoxide of hydrogen by their presence
merely, no action being detected on these bodies.
Edmund Davy found that powdered platinum, moistened
with alcohol, became red-hot, fired the spirit, and converted
it into vinegar, without undergoing, itself, any
chemical change. <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Dœbereiner">Döbereiner</span> next discovered that
spongy platinum fired a current of hydrogen gas
directed upon it, which, by combining with the oxygen
of the air, formed water. Dulong and Thenard traced
the same property, differing only in degree, through
iridium, osmium, palladium, gold, silver, and even glass.
Further investigation has extended the number of
instances; and it has even been found that a polished
plate of platinum has the power of condensing hydrogen
and oxygen so forcibly upon its surface, that these gases
are drawn into combination and form water, with a
development of heat sufficient to ignite the metal.</p>

<p>This power, whatever it may be, is common in both
organic and inorganic nature, and on its important purposes
Berzelius has the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This power gives rise to numerous applications in
organic nature; thus, it is only around the eyes of the
potato that diastase exists: it is by means of catalytic
power that diastase, and that starch, which are insoluble,
are converted into sugar and into gum, which, being
soluble, form the sap that rises in the germs of the
potato. This evident example of the action of catalytic
power in an organic secretion, is not, probably, the only
one in the animal and vegetable kingdom, and it may
hereafter be discovered that it is by an action analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
to that of catalytic power, that the secretion of such
different bodies is produced, all which are supplied by
the same matter, the sap in plants, and the blood in
animals.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>It is, without doubt, to this peculiar agency that we
must attribute the abnormal actions produced in the
blood of living animals by the addition of any gaseous
miasma or putrid matter, of which we have, in all probability,
a fearful example in the progress of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Asatic">Asiatic</span>
cholera; therefore the study of its phenomena becomes
an important part of public hygiène.</p>

<p>Physical research has proved to us that all bodies
have peculiar powers, by which they condense with
varying degrees of force gases and vapours upon their
surfaces; every body in nature may, indeed, be regarded
as forming its own peculiar atmosphere. To this power,
in all probability, does catalysis belong. Different
views have, however, prevailed on this subject, and Dr.
Lyon Playfair<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> argues that the catalytic force is merely
a modified form of chemical affinity, exerted under
peculiar conditions.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the power producing chemical
change, it acts in conformity with some fixed laws, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
in all its transmutations, an obedience to a most harmonious
system is apparent.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe the remarkable character
of many of these natural transmutations of matter, but
we must content ourselves with a few examples only.
For instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sugar, oxalic acid, and citric acid are very unlike
each other, yet they are composed of the same elements;
the first is used as a general condiment, the second is a
destructive poison, and the third a grateful and healthful
acid: sugar is readily converted into oxalic acid, and in
the process of ripening fruits nature herself converts
citric acid into sugar. Again, starch, sugar, and gum
would scarcely be regarded as alike, yet their only difference
is in the mode in which carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen combine. They are composed of the same principles,
in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="chemical analyses of starch, sugar and gum">
<tr><th></th><th class="tdpad">Carbon.</th><th class="tdpad">Hydrogen.</th><th class="tdpad">Oxygen.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Starch</td><td class="tdc">12</td><td class="tdc">10</td><td class="tdc">10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sugar</td><td class="tdc">12</td><td class="tdc">11</td><td class="tdc">11</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gum</td><td class="tdc">12</td><td class="tdc">11</td><td class="tdc">11</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These <i>isomeric</i> groups certainly indicate some law
of affinity which science has not yet discovered.
Similar and even more remarkable instances might be
adduced of the same elements producing compounds
very unlike each other; but the above have been
selected from their well-known characters. Indeed, we
may state with truth that all the varieties of the vegetable
world&mdash;their woody fibre&mdash;their acid or alkaline
juices&mdash;the various exudations of plants&mdash;their flowers,
fruit, and seeds, and the numerous products which, by
art, they are made to yield for the uses of man, are, all
of them, compounds of these three elements, differing
only in the proportions in which they are combined
with nitrogen, or in some peculiar change of state in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
one or other of the elementary principles. The chemist
is now enabled by simple processes, from the refuse of
manufactories to produce fruit essences which are
equal in flavour to the natural production; and from
benzoic acid, which is obtained in great abundance from
the houses in which cows are kept, the most delicate
essences are produced, which are given to the world as
the distillations of a thousand flowers. By the impulse
given to organic chemistry by Liebig, our knowledge of
the almost infinite variety of substances, in physical
character exceedingly dissimilar, which result from the
combination of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, in varying
proportions, has been largely increased. And the
science is now in that state which almost causes a regret
that any new organic compounds should be discovered,
until some industrious mind has undertaken the task of
reducing to a good general classification the immense
mass of valuable matter which has been accumulated,
but which, for all practical purposes, remains nearly useless
and unintelligible.</p>

<p>These combinations, almost infinitely varied as they
are, and so readily produced and multiplied as to be
nearly at the will of the organic analyst, are not, any of
them, accidental: they are the result of certain laws,
and atom has united with atom in direct obedience to
principles which have been through all time in active
operation. They are unknown; the researches of
science have not yet developed them, and the philosopher
has not yet made his deductions. They are to be referred
to some secret fixed principles of action, to a force
which has impressed upon every atom of the universe its
distinguishing character. Chemistry makes us familiar
with a system of order. The researches of analysts
have proved that every body has a particular law of combination,
to which it is bound by a mathematical precision;
but it is not proportional combination alone we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span>
have to consider. If <i>allotrophy</i> is evidenced in the
mineral world, it is certainly far more strikingly manifested
in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.</p>

<p>There are some cases in which bodies appear to combine
without any limitation, as spirit of wine and water,
sulphuric acid and water; but these must be considered
as conditions of mixture rather than of chemical
combination.</p>

<p>The composition of bodies is fixed and invariable,
and a compound substance, so long as it retains its
characteristic properties, must consist of the same
elements united in the same proportions. Thus, sulphuric
acid is invariably composed of 16 parts of sulphur
and 24 parts of oxygen. Chalk, whether formed by
nature or by the chemist, yields 43·71 parts of carbonic
acid, and 56·29 parts of lime. The rust which forms
upon the surface of iron by the action of the atmosphere,
is as invariable in its composition as if it had been
formed by the most delicate adjustment of weight by
the most accurate manipulator, being 28 parts of iron
and 12 parts of oxygen. This law is the basis of all
chemical inquiry, all analytical investigations depending
upon the knowledge it affords us, that we can only produce
certain undeviating compounds as the results of
our decompositions. We are not in a position to offer
any explanation which will account for these constant
quantities in combination. The forces of cohesion and
elasticity have been advanced in explanation, on the
strength of the fact that the solubility of a salt in water
is regulated by cohesion, and that of a gas by its
elasticity. Although it may appear that some cases of
chemical combination are due to these powers,&mdash;as, for
instance, when the union of oxalic acid or sulphuric
acid with lime produces an insoluble salt,&mdash;we cannot
thus explain the constant proportions in which the
metals, sulphur, oxygen, and similar bodies, unite. It
is quite certain there is a power or principle, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
have not yet reached, upon which are dependent all the
phenomena which we now embrace under the term
chemical affinity.</p>

<p>Another law teaches us that when compound bodies
combine in more than one proportion, every additional
union represents a multiple of the combining proportion
of the first. With the difficulty which arises from the
sub-multiple compounds we cannot deal:&mdash;further research
may render their laws less obscure. We have
seen that 8 parts of oxygen unite with 1 of hydrogen
and 14 of nitrogen. It also unites with 110 of silver,

<p>In these proportions, or in multiples of them, and in
no others, will these bodies unite with the acids or other
compounds. It will, of course, be understood that any
other numbers may be adopted, provided they stand in
the same relation to each other.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>From the discovery of these harmonious arrangements
was deduced the beautiful atomic theory to which allusion
has been already made. Indeed, there does not
appear to be any other way of explaining these phenomena
than by the hypothesis that the ultimate atoms
of bodies have <i>relatively</i> the weights which we arbitrarily
assign to them, as their combining quantities.
These views are further confirmed by the fact, that
gaseous bodies unite together by volume in very simple
definite proportions:&mdash;100 measures of hydrogen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
200 measures of oxygen form water; 100 measures of
oxygen and 100 measures of vapour of sulphur form
sulphurous acid gas. Ammoniacal gas consists of 300
volumes of hydrogen and 100 volumes of nitrogen, condensed
by combination into 200 volumes; consequently,
we are enabled most readily to calculate the specific
gravity of ammoniacal gas. The specific gravity of
nitrogen is 0·9722, that of hydrogen 0·0694. Now,
three volumes of hydrogen are equal to 0·2082: this
added to 0·9722 is equal to 1·1804, which is exactly the
specific gravity obtained by experiment.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, from the generality with which
this law of volumes prevails, that it would be found to
extend through all substances, provided they could be
rendered gaseous; in other words, there is abundant
proof to convince us that throughout nature the process
of combination, in the most simple ratio of volumes, is
in operation to produce all the forms of matter known
to us.</p>

<p>It has been shown, by the investigations of Dr. Dalton,
in 1840, that salts, containing water of crystallization,
dissolve in water without increasing the bulk of
the fluid more than is due to the liquefaction of the
water which these salts contain; while Joule and Playfair
have shown that the anhydrous salts take up no
space in solution. From this we are naturally led to
conclude that the volume occupied by a salt in the solid
state has a certain relation to the volume of the same
salt when in solution, and has also a fixed relation to
the volume occupied by any other salt. The law appears
to be:&mdash;the atomic volume of any salt whatever (anhydrous
or hydrated) is a multiple of 11, or of a number
near 11, or a multiple of 9·8 (the atomic volume of ice),
or the sum of a multiple of 11 or 9·8. Marignac, who
has also paid much attention to the subject, does not
think these numbers absolutely correct, but approxi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[Pg 288]</span>mately
so.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> It would be a beautiful exemplification of
the simplicity of Nature’s operations, if it should be
clearly proved that the atomic volume of solid water
(ice) regulated the combining proportions by volume of
all other bodies,&mdash;that it was the standard by which
chemical combination and ordinary solution were
determined.</p>

<p>In addition to the laws already indicated, there appear
to be some others of which, as yet, we have a less satisfactory
knowledge, and, as a remarkable case, we may
adduce the phenomena of <i>substitution</i>, or that power
which an elementary body, under certain conditions,
possesses, of turning out one of the elements of a compound,
and of taking its place.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Thus, the hydrogen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
of a compound radical, as carburetted hydrogen, may be
replaced by chlorine, equivalent for equivalent, and
form a chloride of carbon, which being constructed on
the same type as the original, will have the same general
laws of combination.</p>

<p>Under the influence of these laws, all the combinations
which we discover in nature take place. The metals,
and oxygen, and sulphur, and phosphorus unite. The
elements of the organic type, entering into the closest
relations, give rise to every form of vegetable life. The
acids, the gums, the resins, and the sugar which plants
produce; and those yet more complicated animal substances,
bone, muscle, blood, and bile; albumen, casein,
milk, with those compounds which, under the influence
of vital power, resolve themselves into substances which
are essential to the existence, health, and beauty of the
animal fabric, are all dependent on these laws. But
these metamorphoses must be further considered in our
examination of the more striking cases of chemical
action. The changes which result from organic combination
are so remarkable, and withal they show how
completely the whole of the material world is in subjection
to chemical force, and every variety of form the
result of mysterious combination, that some particular
reference to these metamorphoses is demanded.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases of decided chemical action, all
trace of the characters of the combining bodies disappear.
We say decided chemical action, because,
although sulphuric acid and water combine, and salts
dissolve in water, we may always recognize their
presence, and therefore these and similar cases cannot
be regarded as strict examples of the phenomena under
consideration.</p>

<p>Hydrogen and oxygen, in combining, lose their gaseous
forms, and are condensed into a liquid&mdash;water. Sulphuric
acid is intensely sour and corrosive; potash is
highly caustic; but united they form a salt which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
neither: they appear to have destroyed the distinguishing
characters of each other. Combined bodies frequently
occupy less space than they did previously to combination,
of which numerous particular instances might be adduced.
Gases in many cases undergo a remarkable condensation
when chemically combined. In slaking lime, the water
becomes solid in the molecules of the hydrate of lime
formed, and the intense heat produced arises from the
liberation of that caloric which had been employed to
keep the water liquid. When a solid passes into the
liquid state, cold is produced by the abstraction from
surrounding objects of the heat required to effect fluidity.
An alteration of temperature occurs whenever chemical
change takes place, as we have already shown, with a
few trivial and uncertain exceptions. The disturbance
caused by the exercise of the force of affinity frequently
leads to the development of several physical powers.</p>

<p>Changes of colour commonly arise; indeed, there
does not appear to be any relation between the colour of
a compound and that of its elements. Iodine is of a
deep iron-grey colour; its vapour is violet; yet it forms
beautifully white salts with the alkalies, a splendid red
salt with mercury, and a yellow one with lead. The
salts of iron vary from white and yellow to green and
dark brown. Those of copper, a red metal, are of a
beautiful blue and green colour, and the anhydrous
sulphate is white.</p>

<p>Isomorphism, which appears in a very remarkable
manner among the organic compounds, has, under the
head of crystallization, already had our attention. There
is also a class of bodies which are said to be <i>isomeric</i>;
that is, to have the same composition, although different
in their physical characters. But the idea that bodies
exist, which, although of a decidedly different external
character, are of exactly the same chemical composition
and physical condition, is not tenable; and in nearly all
the examples which have been carefully examined, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>
difference in the aggregate number of atoms, or in the
mode in which those atoms have respectively arranged
themselves, or that peculiar physical difference designated
by the term <i>allotropy</i>, has been detected.</p>

<p>Oil of turpentine and oil of lemons have the same
composition, each being composed of five equivalents of
carbon and four of hydrogen. These substances form,
from the striking difference perceptible in their external
characters, a good example of isomerism.</p>

<p>The laws of organic chemistry are not, however, the
same as those applying to inorganic combinations. Organic
chemistry is well defined by Liebig, as the chemistry
of compound radicals; and under the influence
of vitality, nature produces compounds which have all
the properties of simple elements.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>When we reflect upon the conditions which prevail
throughout nature, with a few of which only has science
made us acquainted, we cannot fail to be struck with
the various phases of being which are presented to our
observation, and the harmonious system upon which
they all appear to depend.</p>

<p>When we discover that bodies are formed of certain
determinate atoms, which unite one with another, according
to an arithmetical system, to form molecules,
which, combining with molecules, observe a similar law,
we see at once that all the harmonies of chemical combination&mdash;the
definite proportions, laws of volume, and
the like&mdash;are but the necessary consequences of these
simple and guiding first principles. In the pursuit of
truth, investigators must discover still further arrangements,
which, from their perfection, may be compared
to the melodious interblending of sweet sounds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>
many of the apparently indeterminate combinations will,
beyond a doubt, be shown to be as definite as any others.
But we cannot reflect upon the fact that these atoms
and these molecules are guided in their combinations by
impulses, which we can only explain by reference to
human passions, as the term <i>elective affinity</i> implies,
without feeling that an impenetrable mystery of a grand
and startling character in its manifestations surrounds
each grain of dust which is hurried along upon the
wind.</p>

<p>We now, habitually, speak of attraction and repulsion&mdash;of
the affinity and non-affinity of bodies. We are
disposed, from the discovery of the attractive and repelling
poles of electrified substances, to regard these
powers in all cases as depending upon some electrical
state, and we write learnedly upon the laws of these
forces. After all, it would be more honest to admit,
that we know no more of the secret impulses which
regulate the combinations of matter, than did those
who satisfied themselves by referring all phenomena of
these kinds to sympathies and antipathies: terms which
have a poetic meaning, conveying to the mind, with
considerable distinctness, the fact, and giving the idea
of a feeling&mdash;a passion&mdash;involving and directing inanimate
matter, similar to that which stirs the human
heart, and certainly calculated to convey the impression
that there is working within all things a living principle,
and pointing, indeed, to “the soul of the world.” The
animated marble of ancient story is far less wonderful
than the fact, proved by investigation, that every atom
of matter is penetrated by a principle which directs its
movements and orders its positions, and involved by an
influence which extends, without limits, to all other
atoms, and which determines their union, or otherwise.</p>

<p>We have gravitation, drawing all matter to a common
centre, and acting from all bodies throughout the wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span>
regions of unmeasured space upon all. We have cohesion,
holding the particles of matter enchained, operating
only at distances too minute for the mathematician
to measure; and we have chemical attraction, different
from either of these, working no less mysteriously within
absolutely insensible distances, and, by the exercise of
its occult power, giving determinate and fixed forms to
every kind of material creation.</p>

<p>The spiritual beings, which the poet of untutored
nature gave to the forest, to the valley, and to the
mountain, to the lake, to the river, and to the ocean,
working within their secret offices, and moulding for
man the beautiful or the sublime, are but the weak
creations of a finite mind, although they have for us a
charm which all men unconsciously obey, even when
they refuse to confess it. They are like the result of
the labours of the statuary, who, in his high dreams of
love and sublimated beauty, creates from the marble
block a figure of the most exquisite moulding which
mimics life. It charms us for a season; we gaze and
gaze again, and its first charms vanish; it is ever and
ever still the same dead heap of chiselled stone. It has not
the power of presenting to our wearying eyes the change
which life alone enables matter to give; and we admit
the excellence of the artist, but we cease to feel at his
work. The creations of poetry are pleasing, but they
never affect the mind in the way in which the poetic
realities of nature do. The sylph moistening a lily is
a sweet dream; but the thoughts which rise when first
we learn that its broad and beautiful dark-green leaves,
and its pure and delicate flower, are the results of the
alchemy which changes gross particles of matter into
symmetric forms,&mdash;of a power which is unceasingly at
work under the guidance of light, heat, and electrical
force,&mdash;are, after our incredulity has passed away&mdash;for
it is too wonderful for the untutored to believe at once&mdash;of
an exalting character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>The flower has grown under the impulse of principles
which have traversed to it on the solar beam, and mingled
with its substance. A stone is merely a stone to
most men. But within the interstices of the stone, and
involving it like an atmosphere, are great and mighty
influences, powers which are fearful in their grander
operations, and wonderful in their gentler developments.
The stone and the flower hold, locked up in their recesses,
the three great known forces&mdash;light, heat, and
electricity: and, in all probability, others of a more
exalted nature still, to which these powers are but subordinate
agents. Such are the facts of science, which,
indeed, are the true “sermons in stones,” and the most
musical of “tongues in trees.” How weak are the creations
of romance, when viewed beside the discoveries of
science! One affords matter for meditation, and gives
rise to thoughts of a most ennobling character; the other
excites for a moment, and leaves the mind vacant or diseased.
The former, like the atmosphere, furnishes a
constant supply of the most healthful matter; the latter
gives an unnatural stimulus, which compels a renewal
of the same kind of excitement, to maintain the continuation
of its pleasurable sensations.</p>

drawn from a familiar order of ideas. Let us put ourselves in the
place of a man overlooking a game at chess without the slightest
knowledge of the game. He would soon remark that the pieces
must be used according to positive rules. In chemistry, the
equivalents are our pieces, and the law of substitutions one of the
rules which preside over their moves. And as in the oblique
move of the pawns one pawn must be substituted for another, so
in the phenomena of substitution one element must take the place
of another. But this does not hinder the pawn from advancing
without taking anything, as the law of substitution does not hinder
an element from acting on a body without displacing or taking
the place of any other element that it may contain.”&mdash;<i>Memoir on

<p class="p2">Without attempting anything which shall approach
even to the character of a sketch of chemical science,
we may be allowed, in our search after exalting truths,
to select such examples of the results of combination as
may serve to elucidate any of the facts connected with
natural phenomena. In doing this, by associating our
examination with well-known natural objects or conditions,
the interpretation afforded by analysis will be
more evident, and the operation of the creative forces
rendered more striking and familiar, particularly if at
the same time we examine such physical conditions as
are allied in action, and are sufficiently explanatory of
important features.</p>

<p>A large portion of this planet is covered by the waters
of the ocean, of lakes and rivers. Water forms the best
means of communication between remote parts of the
earth. It is in every respect of the utmost importance
to the animal and vegetable kingdom; and, indeed, it
is indispensable in all the great phenomena of the inorganic
world. The peculiarities of saltness or freshness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[Pg 296]</span>
in water are dependent upon its solvent powers. The
waters of the ocean are saline from holding dissolved
various saline compounds, which are received in part
from, and imparted also to, the marine plants. Perfectly
pure water is without taste: even the pleasant character
of freshly-drawn spring-water is due to the admixture
of atmospheric air and carbonic acid. The manner in
which water absorbs air is evidently due to a peculiar
physical attractive force, the value of which we do not
at present clearly perceive or correctly estimate. It is
chemically composed of two volumes of hydrogen gas&mdash;the
lightest body known, and at the same time a highly
inflammable one&mdash;united with one volume of oxygen,
which excites combustion, and continues that action,&mdash;producing
heat and light,&mdash;with great energy. By weight,
one part of hydrogen is united with eight of oxygen, or
in 100 parts of water we find 88·9 oxygen, and 11·1 of
hydrogen gas. That two such bodies should unite to
furnish the most refreshing beverage, and indeed the
only natural drink for man and animals, is one of the
extraordinary facts of science. Hydrogen will not support
life&mdash;we cannot breathe it and live; and oxygen
would over-stimulate the organic system, and, producing
a kind of combustion, give rise to fever in the animal
frame; but, united, they form that drink, for a drop of
which the fevered monarch would yield his diadem, and
the deprivation of which is one of the most horrid calamities
that can be inflicted upon any living thing. Water
appears as the antagonist principle to fire, and the
ravages of the latter are quenched by the assuaging
powers of the former; yet a mixture of oxygen and
hydrogen gases, in the exact proportion in which they
form water, explodes with the utmost violence on the
contact of flame, and, when judiciously arranged, produces
the most intense degree of heat known;&mdash;such is the
remarkable difference between a merely mechanical
mixture and a chemical combination. Beyond this, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span>
have already noticed the remarkable fact that water
deprived of air is explosive at a comparatively low temperature,
less than 300°; gunpowder requiring a temperature
of nearly 1000° F.</p>

<p>If we place in a globe, oxygen and hydrogen gases,
in the exact proportions in which they combine to form
water, they remain without change of state. They
appear to mix intimately; and, notwithstanding the
difference in the specific gravities of the two gases, the
lighter one is diffused through the heavier in a curious
manner, agreeably to a law which has an important
bearing on the conditions of atmospheric phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
The moment, however, that an incandescent body, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>
the spark from an electric machine, is brought into
contact with the mixed gases, they ignite, explode violently,
and combine to form water. The discovery of
the composition of water was thus synthetically made
by Cavendish&mdash;its constitution having been previously
theoretically announced by Watt.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>If, instead of combining oxygen and hydrogen in the
proportions in which they form water, we compel the
hydrogen to combine with an additional equivalent of
oxygen, we have a compound possessing many properties
strikingly different from water. This&mdash;peroxide of hydrogen,
as it is called&mdash;is a colourless liquid, less
volatile than water, having a metallic taste. It is
decomposed at a low temperature, and, at the boiling
point, the oxygen escapes from it with such violence,
that something like an explosion ensues. All metals,
except iron, tin, antimony, and tellurium, have a tendency
to decompose this compound, and separate it into
oxygen and water. Some metals are oxidized during
the decomposition, but gold, silver, platinum, and a few
others, still retain their metallic state. If either silver,
lead, mercury, gold, platinum, manganese, or cobalt, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span>
their highest states of oxidation, are put into a tube,
containing this peroxide of hydrogen, its oxygen is
liberated with the rapidity of an explosion, and so much
heat is excited that the tube becomes red hot. These
phenomena, to which we have already referred in
noticing catalysis, are by no means satisfactorily explained,
and the peculiar bleaching property possessed
by the peroxide of hydrogen sufficiently distinguishes
it from water. There are few combinations which show
more strikingly than this the difference arising from
the chemical union of an additional atom of one element.
Similar instances are numerous in the range of chemical
science; but scarcely any two exhibit such dissimilar
properties. During the ordinary processes of combustion,
it has been long known that water is formed by
the combination of the hydrogen of the burning body
with the oxygen of the air. The recent researches of
Schönbein have shown that a peculiar body, which has
been regarded as a peroxide of hydrogen, to which he
has given the name of <span class="smcap">Ozone</span>, is produced at the same
time, and that it is developed in a great many ways,
particularly during electrical changes of the atmosphere.
Thus we obtain evidence that this remarkable compound,
which was considered as a chemical curiosity
merely, is diffused very generally through nature, and
produced under a great variety of circumstances.
During the excitation of an electrical machine, or the
passage of a galvanic current through water by the
oxidation of phosphorus, and probably in many similar
processes&mdash;in particular those of combustion, and we
may therefore infer also of respiration&mdash;this body is
formed. From observations which have been made, it
would appear that, during the night, when the activity
of plants is not excited by light, they act upon the
atmosphere in such a way as to produce this ozone; and
its presence is said to be indicated by its peculiar odour
during the early hours of morning. We are not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span>
acquainted with this body sufficiently to speculate on its
uses in nature: without doubt, they are important,
perhaps second to those of water only. It is probable,
as we have already had occasion to remark, that ozone
may be the active agent in removing from the atmosphere
those organic poisons to which many forms of
pestilence are traceable; and it is a curious fact, that a
low electrical intensity, and a consequent deficiency of
atmospheric ozone, marks the prevalence of cholera, and
an excess distinguishes the reign of influenza.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Some interesting researches appear to show the probability
that ozone is simply oxygen in a state of high
activity. It has been found, indeed, that perfectly dry
oxygen, which will not bleach vegetable colours in the
dark, acquires, by exposure to sunshine, the power of
destroying them. Becquerel has proved that this
ozonous state may be produced in dry oxygen by passing
a succession of electric sparks through it. Fremy
passed the electric sparks on the outside of a tube which
contained perfectly dry oxygen, and it was found to
have acquired the properties of ozone. In this case, and
probably in the experiments of Becquerel, the light of
the spark, rather than the electricity, appears to have
been the active agent in producing this change. Schönbein
himself does not appear disposed to regard ozone
as being either <span class="correction" title="In the original book: per-oxide">peroxide</span> of hydrogen, or an allotropic
oxygen. He leans to his first view of its being an
entirely new chemical element. The energy of this
ozone is so great, that it has been found to destroy
almost instantaneously the Indian-rubber union joints
of the apparatus in which it is formed.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span></p>
<p>Water, from the consideration of which a digression
has been indulged in, to consider the curious character
of one of its elements,&mdash;water is one of the most
powerful chemical agents, having a most extensive
range of affinities, entering directly into the composition
of a great many crystallizable bodies and organic compounds.
In those cases where it is not combined as
water, its elements often exist in the proportions in
which water is formed. Gum, starch, and sugar, only
differ from each other in the proportions in which the
elements of water are combined with the carbon.</p>

<p>In saline combinations, and also in many organic
forms, we must regard the water as condensed to the
solid form; that is, to exist as ice. We well know that,
by the abstraction of heat, this condition is produced;
but, in chemical combinations, this change must be the
result of the mechanical force exerted by the power of
the agency directing affinity.</p>

<p>In the case of water passing from a liquid to a solid
state, we have a most beautiful exemplification of the
perfection of natural operations. Water conducts heat
downwards but very slowly; a mass of ice will remain
undissolved but a few inches under water, on the surface
of which, ether, or any other inflammable body, is
burning. If ice (solid water) swam beneath the surface,
the summer sun would scarcely have power to thaw it;
and thus our lakes and seas would be gradually converted
into solid masses at our ordinary winter temperatures.</p>

<p>All similar bodies contract equally during the process
of cooling, from the highest to the lowest points to
which the experiments have been carried. It has been
thought that if this applied to water, the result would be
the sudden consolidation of the whole mass. A modification
of the law has been supposed to take place to
suit the peculiar circumstances of water. Nature
never modifies a law for a particular purpose; we must,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>
therefore, seek to explain the action of the formation
of ice, as we know it, by some more rational view.</p>

<p>Water expands by heat, and contracts by cold; consequently,
the coldest portions of this body occupy the
lower portions of the fluid; but it must be remembered
that these parts are warmed by the earth. Ross, however,
states that at the depth of 1,000 fathoms the sea
has a constant temperature of 39°. Water is said to be
at its point of greatest density at 40° of Fahrenheit’s
thermometer; in cooling further, this fluid appears to
expand, in the same way as if heated: and, consequently,
water colder than this point, instead of being heavier, is
lighter, and floats on the surface of the warmer fluid.
It does not seem that any modification of the law is required
to account for this phenomenon. Water cooled
to 40° still retains its peculiar corpuscular arrangement;
but immediately it passes below that temperature, it
begins to dispose itself in such a manner that visible
crystals may form the moment it reaches 32°. Now, if
we conceive the particles of water, at 39°, to arrange
themselves in the manner necessary for the assumption
of the solid form, by the particular grouping of molecules
in an angular instead of a spheroidal shape, it will
be clear, from what we know of the arrangement of
crystals of water&mdash;ice&mdash;that they must occupy a larger
space than when the particles are disposed, side by
side, in minute spheres. Even the escape of air from
the water in which it is dissolved is sufficient to give an
apparent lightness to the colder water. This expansion
still goes on increasing, from the same cause, during the
formation of ice, so that the specific gravity of a mass of
frozen water is less than that of water at any temperature
below 40°. It must not be forgotten that ice
always contains a large quantity of air, by which it is
rendered buoyant.</p>

<p>Water, at rest, may be cooled many degrees below
the freezing point without becoming solid. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span>
easily effected in a thin glass flask; but the moment it
is agitated, it becomes a firm mass. Here we have the
indication of another cause aiding in producing crystals
of ice on the surface of water, under the influence of the
disturbance produced by the wind, which does not extend
to any depth.</p>

<p>As oxygen and hydrogen gases enter largely into
other chemical compounds besides water, it is important
to consider some of the forms of matter into the
composition of which these elements enter. To examine
this thoroughly, a complete essay on chemical philosophy
would be necessary; we must, therefore, be content
with referring to a few of the more remarkable
instances.</p>

<p>The waters of the ocean are salt: this arises from
their holding, in solution chloride of sodium (<i>muriate
of soda</i>&mdash;<i>common culinary salt</i>) and other saline bodies.
Water being present, this becomes muriate of soda,&mdash;that
is, a compound of muriatic acid and soda: muriatic
acid is hydrogen, combined with a most remarkable
gaseous body, called, from its yellow colour, <i>chlorine</i>;
and soda, oxygen in union with the metal sodium,&mdash;therefore,
when anhydrous, culinary salt is truly a
chloride of sodium. Chlorine in some respects resembles
oxygen; it attacks metallic bodies with great
energy; and, in many cases, produces the most vivid
incandescence, during the process of combination.
It is a powerful bleaching agent, is destructive to
animal life, and rapidly changes all organic tissues.
There are two other bodies in many respects so similar
to chlorine, although one is at the ordinary temperatures
solid, and the other fluid, and which are
also discovered in sea-water, or in the plants growing
in it, that it is difficult to consider them otherwise
than as different forms of the same principle.
These are iodine and bromine, and they both unite
with hydrogen to form acids. The part which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
chlorine performs in nature is a great and important
one. Combined in muriate of soda, we may
trace it in large quantities through the three kingdoms
of nature, and the universal employment of salt as a condiment
indicates the importance to the animal economy
of the elements composing it. Iodine has been traced
through the greater number of marine plants, existing,
apparently as an essential element of their constitution;
in some land plants it has also been found, particularly
in the Armeria maritima, when this plant grows near
the sea:<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> it has been detected in some mineral springs,
and in small quantities in the mineral kingdom<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> combined
as iodide of silver, and in the aluminous slate
of Latorp in Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Bromine is found in sea-water,
although in extremely minute quantities, in a few
saline springs, and in combination with silver; but we
have no evidence to show that its uses are important in
nature.</p>

<p>Hydrogen, again, unites with carbon in various proportions,
producing the most dissimilar compounds.
The air evolved from stagnant water, and the fire-damp
of the coal mine, are both carburetted hydrogen; and
the gas which we <span class="correction" title="In the original book: emply">employ</span> so advantageously for illumination,
is the same, holding an additional quantity of
carbon in suspension. Naphtha, and a long list of
organic bodies, are composed of these two chemical
elements.</p>

<p>These combinations lead us, naturally, to the consideration
of the great chemical phenomena of combustion,
which involve, indeed, the influences of all the
physical powers. By the application of heat, we pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[Pg 305]</span>duce
an intense action in a body said to be combustible;
it burns,&mdash;a chemical action of the most energetic
character is in progress, the elements which constitute
the combustible body are decomposed, they unite with
some other elementary principles, and new compounds
are formed. A body burns&mdash;it is entirely dissipated, or
it leaves a very small quantity of ashes behind unconsumed,
but nothing is lost. Its volatile parts have
entered into new arrangements, the form of the body is
changed, but its constituents are still playing an
important purpose in creation.</p>

<p>The ancient notion that fire was an empyreal element,
and the Stahlian hypothesis of a phlogistic principle on
which all the effects of combustion depended,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> have
both given way to the philosophy of the unfortunate
Lavoisier&mdash;which has, indeed, been modified in our own
times&mdash;who showed that combustion is but the development
of heat and light under the influence of chemical
combination.</p>

<p>Combustion was, at one period, thought to be always
due to the combination of oxygen with the body burning,
but research has shown that vivid combustion may
be produced where there is no oxygen. The oxidizable
metals burn most energetically in chlorine, and some of
them in the vapour of iodine and bromine, and many
other unions take place with manifestations of incandescence.
Supporters of combustion were, until lately,
regarded as bodies distinct from those undergoing combustion.
For example, hydrogen was regarded as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span>
combustible body, and oxygen as a supporter of combustion.
Such an arrangement is a most illogical one,
since we may <i>burn</i> oxygen in an atmosphere of hydrogen,
in the same manner as we burn hydrogen in
one of oxygen; and so, in all the other cases, the supporter
of combustion may be burnt in an atmosphere
formed of the, so called, combustible. The ordinary
phenomena of combustion are, however, due to the
combination of oxygen with the body burning; therefore
every instance of oxidization may be regarded as a condition
of combustion, the difference being only one of
degree.</p>

<p>Common iron, exposed to air and moisture, <i>rusts</i>; it
combines with oxygen. Pure iron, in a state of fine
division, unites with oxygen so eagerly, that it becomes
incandescent, and in both cases oxide of iron is formed.
This last instance is certainly a case of combustion; but
in what does it differ from the first one, except in the
intensity of the action? The cases of spontaneous
combustion which are continually occurring are examples
of an analogous character to the above. Oxygen
is absorbed, it enters more or less quickly, according to
atmospheric conditions, into chemical combination; heat
is evolved, and eventually,&mdash;the action continually
increasing,&mdash;true combustion takes <span class="correction" title="In the original book: plaee">place</span>. In this way
our cotton-ships, storehouses of flax, piles of oiled-cloth,
sawdust, &amp;c., frequently ignite; and to such an
influence is to be attributed the destruction of two of
our ships of war, a few years since, in Devonport naval
arsenal.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span></p>
<p>In the economic production of heat and light, we
have the combination of hydrogen and carbon with the
oxygen of common air, forming water and carbonic
acid. In our domestic fires we employ coal, which is
essentially a compound of carbon and hydrogen containing
a little oxygen and some nitrogen, with some earthy
matters which must be regarded as impurities; the
taper, whether of wax or tallow, is made up of the same
bodies, differing only in their combining proportions,
and, like coal gas, these burn as carburetted hydrogen.
All these bodies are very inflammable, having a tendency
to combine energetically with oxygen at a certain
elevation of temperature.</p>

<p>We are at a loss to know how heat can cause the
combination of those bodies. Sir Humphry Davy has
shown that hydrogen will not burn, nor a mixture of it
with oxygen explode, unless directly influenced by a
body heated so as to <i>emit light</i>.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> May we not, therefore,
conclude that the chemical action exhibited in a
burning body is a development of some latent force,
with which we are unacquainted, produced by the absorption
of light;&mdash;that a repulsive action at first takes
place, by which the hydrogen and carbon are separated
from each other;&mdash;and that in the nascent state they
are seized by the oxygen, and again compelled, though
in the new forms of water and carbonic acid, to resume
their chains of combining affinity?</p>

<p>Every equivalent of carbon and of hydrogen in the
burning body unites with two equivalents of oxygen, in
strict conformity with the laws of combination. The
flame of hydrogen, if pure, gives scarcely any light, but
combined with the solid particles of carbon, it increases
in brightness. The most brilliant of the illuminating
gases is the olefiant gas, produced by the decomposition
of alcohol, and it is only hydrogen charged with carbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span>
to the point of saturation. Flame is a cone of heated
vapour, becoming incandescent at the points of contact
with the air; a mere superficial film only being luminous.
It is evident that all the particles of the gas are in a
state of very active repulsion over the surface, since
flame will not pass through wire gauze of moderate
fineness. Upon this discovery is founded the inimitable
safety-lamp of Davy, by means of which the explosive
gases of a mine are harmlessly ignited within a cage of
wire gauze. This effect has been attributed to a cooling
influence of the metal; but, since the wires may be
brought to a degree of heat but little below redness
without igniting the fire-damp, this does not appear to
be the cause. The conditions of the safety lamp may
be regarded as presenting examples exactly the converse
of those already stated with reference to the spheroidal
state of water; and it affords additional evidence that
the condition of bodies at high temperatures is subject
to important physical changes.</p>

<p>The principle upon which the safety lamp is constructed
is, that a mixture of the fire-damp and
atmospheric air in certain proportions explodes upon
coming in contact with a flame.</p>

<p>This mixture passes readily through a wire gauze,
under all circumstances, and it, of course, thus approaches
the flame of the lamp enclosed within such a
material, and it explodes. But, notwithstanding the
mechanical force with which the exploding gas is thrown
back against the bars of its cage, it cannot pass them.
Consequently, the element of destruction is caught and
caged; and notwithstanding its fierceness and energy, it
cannot impart to the explosive atmosphere without, any
of its force. No combustion can be communicated
through the wire gauze.</p>

<p>The researches which led to the safety-lamp may be
regarded as among the most complete examples of
correct inductive experiment in the range of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span>
science, and the result is certainly one of the proudest
achievements of physico-chemical research. By merely
enveloping the flame of a lamp with a metallic gauze, the
labourer in the recesses of the gloomy mine may feel
himself secure from that outpouring current of inflammable
gas, which has been so often the minister of
death; he may walk unharmed through the explosive
atmosphere, and examine the intensity of its power, as
it is wasted in trifling efforts within the little cage he
carries. Accidents have been attributed to the “Davy,”
as the lamp is called among the colliers; but they may
in most cases be traced to carelessness on the part of
those whose duty it has been to examine the lamps, or
to the recklessness of the miners themselves.</p>

<p>That curious metal, platinum, and also palladium,
possesses a property of maintaining a slow combustion,
which the discoverer of the safety-lamp proposed to
render available to a very important purpose. If we
take a coil of platinum wire, and, having made it red-hot,
plunge it into an explosive atmosphere of carburetted
hydrogen and common air, it continues to
glow with considerable brightness, producing, by this
very peculiar influence, a combination of the gases,
which is discovered by the escape of pungent acid
vapours. Over the little flame of the safety-lamp, it was
proposed by Davy to suspend a coil of platinum which
would be thus kept constantly at a red heat. If the
miner became accidentally enveloped in an atmosphere
of fire-damp, although the flame of his lamp might be
extinguished, the wire would continue to glow with
sufficient brightness to light him from his danger,
through the dark winding passages which have been
worked in the bed of fossil fuel. This very beautiful
arrangement has not, however, been adopted by our
miners.</p>

<p>It is thus that the discoveries of science, although they
may appear of an abstract character, constantly, sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
or later, are applied to uses by which some branch of
human labour is assisted, the necessities of man’s condition
relieved, and the amenities of life advanced.</p>

<p>The respiration of animals is an instance of the same
kind of chemical phenomena as we discover in ordinary
combustion. In the lungs the blood becomes charged
with oxygen, derived from the atmospheric air, with which
it passes through the system, performing its important
offices, and the blood is returned to the lungs with the
carbonic acid formed by the separation of carbon from
the body which is thrown off at every expiration. It
will be quite evident that this process is similar to that
of ordinary combustion. In man or animals, as in the
burning taper,&mdash;which is aptly enough employed by
poets as the symbol of life,&mdash;we have hydrogen and
carbon, with some nitrogen superadded; the hydrogen
and oxygen form water under the action of the vital
forces; the carbon with oxygen produces carbonic acid,
and, by a curious process, the nitrogen and hydrogen
also combine, to form ammonia.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>All the carbon which is taken into the animal economy
passes, in the process of time, again into the atmosphere,
in combination with oxygen, this being effected in the
body, under the <i>catalytic</i> power of tissues, immediately
influenced by the excitation of nervous forces, which are
the direct manifestations of vital energy. The quantity
of carbonic acid thus given out to the air is capable of
calculation, with only a small amount of error. It
appears that upwards of fifty ounces of carbonic acid
must be given off from the body of a healthy man in
twenty-four hours. On the lowest calculation, the population
of London must add to the atmosphere daily
4,500,000 pounds of carbonic acid. It must also be remembered
that in every process for artificial illumination,
and in all the operations of the manufactures in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span>
fire is used, and also in our arrangements to secure domestic
comfort, immense quantities of this gas are
formed. We may, indeed, fairly estimate the amount,
if we ascertain the quantity of wood and coal consumed,
of all the carbon which combines with oxygen while
burning, and escapes into the air, either as carbonic acid
or carbonic oxide. The former gas, the same as that
which accumulates in deep wells and in brewers’ vats,
is highly destructive to life, producing very distressing
symptoms, even when mixed with atmospheric air, in
but slight excess over that proportion which it commonly
contains. The oppressive atmosphere of crowded
rooms is in a great measure due to the increased proportion
of carbonic acid given off from the lungs of those assembled,
and collected in the almost stagnant air of badly
ventilated apartments. It will be evident to every one, that
unless some provision was made for removing this deleterious
gas from the atmosphere as speedily as it formed,
consequences of the most injurious character to the
animal races would ensue. It is found, however, that
the quantity in the atmosphere is almost constantly
about one per cent. The peculiar properties of carbonic
acid in part ensure its speedy removal. It is among
the heaviest of gaseous bodies, and it is readily absorbed
by water; consequently, floating within a short distance
from the surface of the earth, a large quantity is dissolved
by the waters spread over it. A considerable
portion is removed by the vegetable kingdom; indeed,
the whole of that produced by animals, and by the
processes of combustion, eventually becomes part of
the vegetable world, being absorbed with water by the
roots, and separated from the air by the peculiar functions
of the leaves. However, this heavy gas unites
with the lighter atmospheric fluid in obedience to that
law which determines the diffusion of different specific
gravities through each other.</p>

<p>The leaves of plants may be regarded as performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[Pg 312]</span>
similar offices to the lungs of animals. They are the
breathing organs. In the animal economy a certain
quantity of carbon is necessarily retained, in combination
with nitrogen and other elements, to form muscle; but
this is constantly undergoing change; the entire system
being renewed within a comparatively limited period.
The conditions with plants are somewhat different. For
instance, the carbon is fixed in a tree, and remains
as woody fibre until it decays, even though the life of
the plant may extend over centuries.</p>

<p>Animals, then, are constantly supplying carbonic
acid; plants are as constantly feeding on it; thus is the
balance for ever maintained between the two kingdoms.
Another condition is, however, required to maintain for
the uses of men and animals the necessary supply of
oxygen gas. This is effected by one of those wonderful
operations of nature’s chemistry which must strike
every reflecting mind with admiration. During the
night plants absorb carbonic acid; but there is a condition
of repose prevailing then in their functions, and
consequently their powers of effecting the decomposition
of this gas are reduced to their minimum. The plant
sleeps, and vital power reposes; its repose being as
necessary to the plant as to the animal. With the first
gleam of the morning sun the dormant energies of the
plant are awakened into full action; it decomposes this
carbonic acid, secretes the carbon, to form the rings of
wood which constitute so large a part of its structure,
and pour out oxygen gas to the air. The plant
is, therefore, an essential element in the conditions
necessary for the support of animal life.</p>

<p>The animal produces carbonic acid in an exact proportion
to the quantity of carbonaceous matter which
it consumes. Fruit and herbage contain a small quantity
of carbon in comparison with muscle and fat. But
let us confine our attention to the human race. Man
within the Tropics, where the natural temperature is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
high, does not require so great an amount of chemical
action to go on within him for the purpose of maintaining
the requisite animal heat; consequently his
Maker has surrounded him with fruits and grains which
constitute his food.</p>

<p>As we advance to the colder regions of the earth
man becomes a flesh-eater, and his carnivorous appetite
increases as the external temperature diminishes.
Eventually we reach the coldest zones, and the human
being there devours enormous quantities of fat to
supply the necessities of his condition.</p>

<p>It must necessarily follow, that the inhabitants of the
tropics do not produce so much carbonic acid as those
who dwell in colder regions. In the first place, their
habits of life are different, and they are not under the
necessity of maintaining animal heat by the use of artificial
combustion, as are the people of colder climes.
The vegetation of the regions of the tropics is much
more luxuriant than that of the temperate and arctic
zones. Hence an additional supply of carbonic acid is
required between the torrid zones, and a less quantity
is produced by its animals. These cases are all met by
the great aërial movements. A current of warmed air,
rich in oxygen, moves from the equator towards the
poles, whilst the cooler air, charged with the excess of
carbonic acid, sets in a constant stream towards the
equator. By this means the most perfect equalization
of the atmospheric conditions is preserved.</p>

<p>The carbonic acid poured out from the thousand
mouths of our fiery furnaces,&mdash;produced during the
laborious toil of the hard-working artizan,&mdash;and exhaled
from every populous town of this our island
home,&mdash;is borne away by this our aërial currents to
find its place in the pines of the Pacific Islands, the
spice-trees of the Eastern Archipelago, and the cinchonas
of Southern America. The plants of the valley
of the Caucasus, and those which flourish amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span>
the Himalayas, equally with the less luxuriant vegetation
of our temperate climes, are directly dependent
upon man and the lower animals for their supply of
food.</p>

<p>If all plants were removed from the earth, animals
could not exist. How would it be if the animal kingdom
was annihilated?&mdash;would it be possible for vegetation
to continue? This question is not quite so
easily answered; but, if we suppose all the carbon-producing
machines&mdash;the animals&mdash;to be extinct, from
whence would the plants draw their supply? It has
been supposed that during the epoch of the coal formation
a luxuriant vegetation must have gone on over
the earth’s surface, when the existence of animal life was
regarded as problematical. It is supposed that the air was
then charged with carbonic acid, and that the calamites,
lepidodendra, and sigilaria, were employed to remove it,
and fit the earth for the oxygen-breathing races. The
evidence upon these points is by no means satisfactory;
and although at one time quite disposed to acquiesce in
a conjecture which appears to account so beautifully for
the observed geological phenomena of carboniferous
periods, we do not regard the necessities for such a
condition of the atmosphere as clearly made out.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Geological research, too, has shown that the immense
forests from which our coal is formed teemed with life.
A frog as large as an ox existed in the swamps, and the
existence of insects proves the high order of organic
creation at this epoch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span></p>
<p>In all probability the same mutual dependence which
now exists between the animal and vegetable kingdoms
existed from the beginning of time, and will continue to
do so under varying circumstances through the countless
ages of the earth’s duration.</p>

<p>There is yet another very important chain of circumstances
which binds these two great kingdoms together.
This is the chain of the animal necessities. A large
number of races feed directly upon vegetables; herbs
and fruits are the only things from which they gain
those elements required to restore the waste of their
systems.</p>

<p>These herbivorous animals, which must necessarily
form fat and muscle from the elements of their vegetable
diet, are preyed on by the carnivorous races; and from
these the carbon is again restored to the vegetable world.
Sweep off from the earth the food of the herbivora, they
must necessarily very soon perish, and with their dissolution,
the destruction of the carnivora is certainly
ensured. To illustrate this on a small scale, it may be
mentioned that around the coasts of Cornwall, pilchards
were formerly caught in very great abundance, in the
shallow water within coves, where these fish are now but
rarely seen. From the investigations of the Messrs.
Couch, whose very accurate observations on the Cornish
fauna have placed both father and son amongst the most
eminent of British naturalists,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> it appears that the
absence of these fish is to be attributed entirely to the
practice of the farmers, who cut the sea-weed from the
rocks for the purpose of manuring their lands. By this
they destroy all the small crustacea inhabiting these
immature marine forests feeding on the algæ, and as
these, the principal food of the pilchards, have perished
they seek for a substitute in more favourable situations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>
Mr. Darwin remarks, that if the immense <span class="correction" title="In the original book: seaweeds">sea-weeds</span> of
the Southern Ocean were removed by any cause, the
whole fauna of these seas would be changed.</p>

<p>We have seen that animals and vegetables are composed
principally of four elementary principles,&mdash;oxygen,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. We have examined
the remarkable manner in which they pass from one
condition&mdash;from one kingdom of nature&mdash;into another.
The animal, perishing and dwindling by decomposition
into the most simple forms of matter, mingling with the
atmosphere as mere gas, gradually becomes part of the
growing plant, and by like changes vegetable organism
progresses onward to form a portion of the animal
structure.</p>

<p>A plant exposed to the action of natural or artificial
decomposition passes into air, leaving but a few grains
of solid matter behind it. An animal, in like manner,
is gradually resolved into “thin air.” Muscle, and
blood, and bones, having undergone the change, are
found to have escaped as gases, leaving only “a pinch
of dust,” which belongs to the more stable mineral
world. Our dependency on the atmosphere is therefore
evident. We derive our substance from it&mdash;we are,
after death, resolved again into it. We are really but
fleeting shadows. Animal and vegetable forms are little
more than consolidated masses of the atmosphere. The
sublime creations of the most gifted bard cannot rival
the beauty of this, the highest and the truest poetry of
science. Man has divined such changes by the unaided
powers of reason, arguing from the phenomena which
science reveals in unceasing action around him. The
Grecian sage’s doubts of his own identity, were only an
extension of a great truth beyond the limits of our
reason. Romance and superstition resolve the spiritual
man into a visible form of extreme ethereality in the
spectral creations, “clothed in their own horror,” by
which their reigns have been perpetuated.</p>

<p>he painted, with considerable correctness, the chemical
changes by which decomposing animal matter is replaced

<p>But the gifted have the power of looking through the
veil of nature, and they have revelations more wonderful
than even those of the philosopher, who evokes them
by perpetual toil and brain-racking struggle with the
ever-changing elements around him.</p>

<p>The mysteries of flowers have ever been the charm of
the poet’s song. Imagination has invested them with
a magic influence, and fancy has almost regarded them
as spiritual things. In contemplating their surpassing
loveliness, the mind of every observer is improved, and
the sentiments which they inspire, by their mere external
elegance, are great and good. But in examining
the real mysteries of their conditions, their physical
phenomena, the relations in which they stand to the
animal world, “stealing and giving odours” in the marvellous
interchange of carbonic acid and ammonia for
the soul-inspiring oxygen&mdash;all speaking of the powers of
some unseen, in-dwelling principle, directed by a supreme
ruler&mdash;the philosopher finds subjects for deep and soul-trying
contemplation. Such studies lift the mind into
the truly sublime of nature. The poet’s dream is the
dim reflection of a distant star: the philosopher’s revelation
is a strong telescopic examination of its features.
One is the mere echo of the remote whisper of nature’s
voice in the dim twilight; the other is the swelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
music of the harp of Memnon, awakened by the sun of
truth, newly risen from the night of ignorance.</p>

<p>To return from our long, but somewhat natural
digression, to a consideration of the chemical phenomena
connected with the atmosphere, and its curious and
important element, nitrogen, we must first examine the
evidence we have of the condition of the air itself.</p>

<p>The mean pressure exerted upon the surface of the
earth, as indicated by the barometer, is equal to a column
of mercury thirty inches high; that is, the column of
air from the surface of the ocean to its highest limits
exactly balances that quantity of mercury. If our
tube of mercury had the area of one square inch,
the columns would weigh fifteen pounds, which represents
a pressure of fifteen pounds upon every square
inch of the earth’s surface. This pressure, it must be
remembered, is the compound weight of the gaseous
envelope, and the elastic force of the aqueous vapour
contained in it.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> If the atmosphere were of uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span>
condition, its height, as inferred from the barometer,
would be about five miles and a half. The density of
the air, however, diminishes with the pressure upon it,
so that at the height of 11,556 feet, the atmosphere is
of half density; or one volume of air, as taken at the
surface of the earth, is expanded into two at that height.
Thus the weight is continually diminishing; but this is
regularly opposed by the decreasing temperature, which
diminishes the rate of about one degree for every 352
feet of ascent, although in all probability it is less
rapid at great distances from the earth.</p>

<p>It has been calculated from certain phenomena of
refraction, that our atmosphere must extend to about
forty miles from the surface of the earth. It may, in
a state of extreme tenuity, extend still further; but
it is probable that the intense cold produced by rarefaction
sets limits to any extension much beyond this
elevation.</p>

<p>The uses of the atmosphere are many. It is the
medium for regulating the dispersion of watery vapours
over the earth. If there were no atmosphere, and
that, as now, the equatorial climes were hot and the
poles cold, evaporation would be continually going on
at the equator, and condensation in the colder regions.
The sky of the tropical climes would be perpetually
cloudless, whilst in the temperate and arctic zones we
should have constant rain and snow. By having a
gaseous atmosphere, a more uniform state of things is
produced; the vapours arising from the earth become
intimately mixed with the air, and are borne by it
over large tracts of country, and only precipitated
when they enter some stratum much colder than that
which involves them. There are opposite tendencies in
an atmosphere of air and one of vapour. The air circulates
from the colder to the warmer parts, and the
vapour from the warmer to the colder regions; and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span>
the currents of the air, from the distribution of land and
sea&mdash;the land, from its low conducting power, being
more quickly heated than the sea&mdash;are very complicated,
and as some force is employed in keeping the vapour
suspended in the air, water is less suddenly deposited on
the earth than it would have been, had not these tendencies
of the air and its hygrometric peculiarities been
such as we find them.</p>

<p>The blue colour of the sky, which is so much more
agreeable to the eye than either red or yellow, is due to
a tendency of the mixed gas and vapour to reflect the
blue rays rather than red or yellow. The white light
which falls upon the surface of the earth, without absorption
or decomposition in its passage from the sun,
is partially absorbed by, and in part reflected back from,
the earth. The reflected rays pass with tolerable freedom
through this transparent medium, but a portion of
the blue rays are interrupted and rendered visible to us.
That it is reflected light, is proved by the fact of its being
in a polarized state.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Clouds of vapour reflect to us
again, not isolated rays, but the undecomposed beam,
and consequently they appear white as snow to our
vision.</p>

<p>The golden glories of sunset,&mdash;when, “like a dying
dolphin,” heaven puts on the most gorgeous hues, which
are continually changing,&mdash;depend entirely upon the
quantity of watery vapour which is mixed with air, and
its state of condensation. It has been observed, that
steam at night, issuing into the atmosphere under a
pressure of twenty or thirty pounds to the square inch,
transmits and reflects orange-red light. This we may,
therefore, conclude to be the property of such a condition
of mixed vapour and air, as prevails when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[Pg 321]</span>
rising or the setting sun is shedding over the eastern
or the western horizon the glory of its coloured rays.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Thus science points out to us the important uses of
the air. We learn that life and combustion are entirely
dependent on it, and that it is made the means for
securing greater constancy in the climates of the earth
than could otherwise be obtained. The facts already
dwelt upon are sufficient to convince every thinking
mind that the beautiful system of order which is displayed
in the composition of the atmosphere, in which
the all-exciting element, oxygen, is subdued to a tranquil
state by another element, nitrogen, (which, we shall
have presently to show, is itself, under certain conditions,
one of the most energetic agents with which we
are acquainted,) indicates a supreme power, omniscient
in the adaptation of things to an especial end. Oxygen
and nitrogen are here <i>mixed</i> for the benefit of man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[Pg 322]</span>
man <i>unites</i> them by the aid of powers with which he is
gifted, and the consequences are of a fatal kind. The
principles which the great Chemist of Nature renders
mild are transformed into sources of evil by the chemist
of art.</p>

<p>Beyond all this, the atmosphere produces effects on
light which add infinitely to the beauty of the world.
Were there no atmosphere, we should only see those objects
upon which the sun’s rays directly fell, or from which
they were reflected. A ray falling through a small hole
into a dark room, illuminating one object, which reflects
some light upon another, is an apt illustration of the
effect of light upon the earth, if it existed without its
enveloping atmosphere. By the dispersive powers of
this medium, sunlight is converted into daylight; and
instead of unbearable, parallel rays illuminating brilliantly,
and scorching up with heat those parts upon
which they directly fall, leaving all other parts in the
darkness of night, we enjoy the blessings of a diffusion
of its rays, and experience the beauties of soft shades
and slowly-deepening shadows. Without an atmosphere,
the sun of the morning would burst upon us with unbearable
brilliancy, and leave us suddenly, at the close
of day, at once in utter darkness. With an atmosphere
we have the twilight with all its tempered loveliness,&mdash;a
“time for poets made.”</p>

<p>In chemical character, atmospheric air is composed of
twenty-one volumes of oxygen, and seventy-nine volumes
of nitrogen: or one hundred grains of air consist of 23·1
grains of the former, and 76·9 grains of the latter.
Whether the air is taken from the greatest depths or the
most exalted heights to which man has ever reached, an
invariable proportion of the gases is maintained. The
air of Chimborazo, of the arid plains of Egypt, of the
pestilential delta of the Niger, or even of the infected
atmosphere of an hospital, all give the same proportions
of these two gases as we find existing on the healthful hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[Pg 323]</span>
of Devonshire, or in the air of the city of London. This
constancy in constitution leads to the supposition that
the oxygen and nitrogen are chemically combined; but
many eminent philosophers have contended that they
are merely mechanically mixed; and they have shown
that some peculiar properties prevail amongst gaseous
bodies, which very fully explain the equal admixture of
two gases the specific gravities of which are different.
This is particularly exemplified in the case of carbonic
acid, of which gas one per cent. can be detected in all
regions of the air to which the investigations of man
have reached. This gas, although so heavy, is, by the
law of diffusion, mixed with great uniformity throughout
the mass.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Every exhalation from the earth, of course,
passes into the air; but these are generally either so
light that they are carried into the upper regions, and
there perform their parts in the meteorological phenomena,
or they are otherwise very readily absorbed by
water or growing plants, and thus is the atmosphere
preserved in a state of purity for the uses of animals.
Again, the quantity of oxygen contained in the air, and
its very peculiar character, ensures the oxidation of all
the volatile organic matters which are constantly passing
off,&mdash;as the odoriferous principles of plants, the miasmata
of swamps, and the products of animal putrefaction;
these are rapidly converted into water, carbonic
acid, or nitric acid, and quickly enter into new and harmless
combinations. The elements of contagion we are
unacquainted with; but since the attention of inquirers
has been of late directed to this important and delicate
subject, some light may possibly be thrown upon it
before long.</p>

<p>Nothing, shows more strikingly the admirable adaptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[Pg 324]</span>
of all things for their intended uses than the atmosphere.
In it we find the source of life and health; and chemistry
teaches us, most indisputably, that it is composed of
certain proportions of oxygen and nitrogen gases; and
experience informs us that it is on the oxygen that we are
dependent for all that we enjoy. So beautifully is the
atomic or molecular constitution ordered, that it is impossible
to produce any change in the air without rendering it
injurious to the vegetable and animal economy. It might
be thought, from the well-known exhilirating character
of oxygen gas, that, if a larger quantity existed in the
atmosphere than that which we find there, the enjoyments
of life would be of a more exciting kind; but the
consequences of any increase would be exceedingly injurious;
and, by quickening all the processes of life to an
unnatural extent, the animal fabric would soon decay:
excited into fever, it would be destroyed by its own fires.
Chemistry has made us acquainted with six other compounds
of oxygen and nitrogen, neither of them fitted
for the purposes of vitality, of which the following are
the most remarkable:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nitrous oxide, or the, so called, <i>laughing gas</i>, which
contains two volumes of nitrogen to one of oxygen,
would prove more destructive than even pure oxygen,
from the delirious intoxication which it produces.</p>

<p>Nitric oxide is composed, according to Davy, of two
volumes of nitrogen and two of oxygen. It is of so
irritating a nature, that the glottis contracts spasmodically
when any attempt is made to breathe it; and
the moment it escapes into the air it combines with
more oxygen, and forms the deep red fumes of nitrous
acid.</p>

<p>Nitrous acid and the peroxide of nitrogen each contains
an additional proportion of oxygen, and they are
still more destructive to all organization.</p>

<p>Nitric acid contains five volumes of oxygen united to
two of nitrogen; and the well-known destructive properties
of aqua fortis it is unnecessary to describe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>The atmosphere, and these chemically active compounds,
contain the same elements, but their mode of
combining is different; and what is, in the one case,
poisonous to the highest degree, is, in the other, rendered
salubrious, and essential to all organized beings.</p>

<p>Nitrogen gas may be regarded in the light of a diluent
to the oxygen. In its pure state it is only characterised
by its negative properties. It will not burn, or act as
a supporter of combustion. Animals speedily perish if
confined in it; but they die rather through the absence
of oxygen than from any poisonous property of this gas.
Yet, in combination, we find nitrogen exhibiting powers
of a most energetic character. In addition to the fulminating
compounds and the explosive substances
already named, which are among the most remarkable
instances of unstable affinity with which we are acquainted,
we have also the well-known pungent body,
ammonia. From the analogous nature of this volatile
compound, and the fixed alkalies soda and potash, it
was inferred that it must, like them, be an oxide of a
metallic base. Davy exposed ammonia to the action of
potassium, and to the influence of the voltaic arc produced
from 2,000 double plates, without at all changing
its character. From its slight tendency to combination,
and from its being found abundantly in the organs of
animals feeding on substances that do not contain it, it
is, however, probably a compound body. A phenomenon
of an obscure and mysterious character is presented in
the formation of the “ammoniacal amalgam,” as it is
called.</p>

<p>Mercury, being mixed with an ammoniacal salt, is
exposed to powerful galvanic action; and a compound,
maintaining its metallic appearance, but of considerable
lightness and very porous, presents itself.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> This prepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span>ration
has been carefully examined by Davy, Berzelius,
and others. It is always resolved into ammonia and
mercury; and, although the latter chemist is strongly
inclined to regard it as affording evidence of the compound
nature of nitrogen,&mdash;and he has, indeed, proposed
the name <i>nitricum</i> for its hypothetical base,&mdash;yet, to the
present time, we have no satisfactory explanation of this
apparent metallization of ammonia.</p>

<p>No attempt will be made to describe the various elementary
substances which come under the class of
metallic bodies, much less to enumerate their combinations.
Many of the metals, as silver and copper, are
found sometimes in a native state, or nearly pure; but,
for the most part, they exist, in nature, in combination
with oxygen or sulphur; gold furnishing a remarkable
exception. They are occasionally found combined with
other bodies,&mdash;as oxidized carbon, phosphorus, chlorine,
&amp;c.; but these cases are by no means so common.
Those substances called metals are generally found embedded
in the rocks, or deposited in fissures formed
through them; but it is one of the great discoveries of
modern science, that those rocks themselves are metallic
oxides. With metals we generally associate the idea of
great density; but potassium and sodium, the metallic
bases of potash and soda, are lighter than water, and
they consequently float upon that fluid. We learn,
therefore, from the researches of science, that the crust
of this earth is composed entirely of metals, combined
with gaseous elements; and there is reason for believing
that one, or perhaps two, of the gases we have already
named are also of a metallic character. Strange as it
may appear, there is nothing, as will be seen on attentive
consideration, irrational in this idea. Many of the
metals proper, under the influence of such heat as we
can, by artificial means, command, are dissipated in vapour,
and may be maintained in this state perfectly invisible.
Indeed, the transparent space above the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[Pg 327]</span>
of the mercury in the tube of a barometer, known as the
Torricellian vacuum, is filled with the vapour of mercury.
There is, therefore, no reason why nitrogen, or
even hydrogen, should not be metallic molecules kept
by the force of the repulsive powers of heat, or some
other influence, at a great distance from each other.
The peculiar manner in which nitrogen unites with mercury,
and the property which hydrogen possesses of
combining with antimony, zinc, arsenic, potassium,
sodium, and possibly other metals, besides its union with
sulphur and carbon&mdash;in all which cases there is no such
change of character as occurs when they combine with
oxygen&mdash;appear to indicate bodies which, chemically, are
not very dissimilar to those metals themselves, although,
physically, they have not the most remote resemblance.</p>

<p>“We know nothing,” says Davy, “of the true elements
belonging to nature; but, so far as we can reason
from the relations of the properties of matter, hydrogen
is the substance which approaches nearest to what the
elements may be supposed to be. It has energetic powers
of combination, its parts are highly repulsive as to each
other, and attractive of the particles of other matter; it
enters into combination in a quantity very much smaller
than any other substance, and in this respect it is
approached by no known body.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Many of the elements are common to the three kingdoms
of nature: most of those found in one condition of
organization are discovered in another. The carbonates
are an abundant mineral class. In the vegetable kingdom
we find carbon combining with oxygen, hydrogen, and
nitrogen: these elements, also, constitute the substance
of animals, the proportion of nitrogen being, however,
much larger. If one element, more than another, belongs
especially to the animal economy, it is phosphorus,
although this is not wanting in the vegetable world;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[Pg 328]</span>
and it is not uncommon in the mineral. Sulphur is
common to the three kingdoms: it is abundant in the
mineral, being one of the products of volcanic action;
it is united with the metals, forming sulphurets; and is
found in our rocks in the state of sulphuric acid or
oxidized vapour, combined with the metallic bases of
lime and other earths. In the vegetable kingdom we
discover sulphur in all plants of the onion kind, in the
mustard, and some others; it enters into the composition
of vegetable albumen, and appears always combined with
albumen, fibrine, and caseine, in the animal economy.</p>

<p>Chlorine is found most abundantly in combination
with sodium, as common salt: in this state, in particular,
we may trace it from the depths of the earth, its
waters, and its rocks, to the plants and animals of the
surface. Iodine is most abundant in marine plants;
but it has been found in the mineral world, traced to
plants, and it is indicated in the flesh of some animals.
Bromine is known to us as a product of certain saline
waters, and a few specimens of natural bromide of silver
have been examined. Fluorine, the base of the acid
which, combining with lime, forms fluor-spar, is found
to exist to some considerable extent in bones; it has
been discovered in milk and blood; and investigations
have proved its existence in the vegetable world. It
must not be forgotten that the earths, lime and magnesia,
enter into the composition of the more solid parts
of plants and animals. Lime is one of the principal
constituents of animal bone and shells, and it is found
in nearly all vegetables.</p>

<p>Silica, or the <i>earth</i> of flints, is met with in beautiful
transparent crystals, in the depths of the mine; in all
rock and soils we find it. In the bark of many plants,
particularly the grasses, it is discovered, forming the
hard supporting cuticle of the stalk, in wheat, the Dutch
rush, the sugar-cane, the bamboo, and many other
plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>It is thus that we find the same elementary principle
presenting itself in every form of matter, under
the most Protean shapes. Numerous phenomena of
even a more striking character than those selected, are
exhibited in every department of chemistry; but within
the limits of this essay it is impracticable to speak
of any beyond those which directly explain natural
phenomena.</p>

<p>The chemical elements, which actually exist in nature
as simple bodies, are probably but few. Most of the
gases are in all probability compounds of some ethereal
ultimate principles; and with the advance of science we
may fairly hope to discover the means of reducing some
of them to a yet more simple state.</p>

<p>Curious relations, which can be traced through certain
bodies, lead us to believe that they may be only modified
conditions of one element. Flint and charcoal do not at
first appear allied; but carbon in some of its states
approaches very near to the condition of silicon, the
metallic base of flint. When we remember the differences
which are evident in three forms of one body&mdash;coke,
graphite, and diamond&mdash;the dissimilitude between flint,
a quartz crystal, and carbon, will cease to be a strong
objection to the speculation.</p>

<p>Phosphorus, sulphur, and selenium, have many properties
in common. Iodine, bromine, chlorine, and
fluorine, appear to belong to the same group. Iron and
nickel, and cobalt, have a close relation. Silver and
lead are usually combined, and exhibit a strong relationship.
Gold, platinum, and the rarer metals, have so
many properties in common, that they may form a
separate group from all the others.</p>

<p>Indeed, a philosophical examination of the elements
now supposed to constitute the material world, enables
us to divide them into about six well-defined groups.
Wide differences exist within these groups; but still we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span>
find a sufficient number of common properties to warrant
our classing them in one family.</p>

<p>The dream of the alchemists, in the vain endeavour
to realise which they exhausted their lives and dissipated
their wealth, had its foundation in a natural truth. The
transmutation of one form of matter into another may
be beyond the power of man, but it is certainly continually
taking place in the laboratory of nature, under
the directing law of the great Creator of this beautiful
earth.</p>

<p>The speculations of men, through all ages, have leaned
towards this idea, as is shown by the theory of the four
elements,&mdash;Air, Fire, Earth, and Water,&mdash;of the ancients,
the three,&mdash;Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury,&mdash;of the alchemists,
and the refined speculations of Newton and
Boscovich on the ultimate constitution of matter. All
experimental inquiry points towards a similar conclusion.
It is true we have no direct evidence of any
elementary atom actually undergoing a change of state;
but when we regard the variations produced by electrical
influence, the changes of state which arise from the
power of heat, and the physical alterations produced by
light, it will be difficult to come to any other conclusion
than that the particles of matter known to us as ultimate
are capable of change, and consequently must be far
removed from positively simple bodies, since the real
elementary atom, possessing fixed properties, cannot be
supposed capable of undergoing any transmutation.
Allotropism could not occur in any absolutely simple
body.</p>

<p>It will now be evident that in all chemical phenomena
we have the combined exercise of the great physical
forces, and evidences of some powers which are, as yet,
shrouded in the mystery of our ignorance. The formation
of minerals within the clefts of the rocks, the
decomposition of metallic lodes, the germination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[Pg 331]</span>
seeds, the growth of the plant, the development of its
fruit and its ultimate decay, the secret processes of
animal life, assimilation, digestion, and respiration, and
all the changes of external form, which take place around
us, are the result of the exercise of that principle which
we call chemical.</p>

<p>By chemical action plants take from the atmosphere
the elements of their growth; these they yield to
animals, and from these they are again returned to the
air. The viewless atmosphere is gradually formed into
an organized being, the lordly tree upon whose branches
the fowls of the air have their homes, and the human
animal, exalted by being charged with a spiritual soul:
yet the tree and the man alike are gradually resolved
again into thin air. The changes of the mineral world
are of an analogous character; but we cannot trace them
so clearly in all their phenomena.</p>

<p>The planet on which we live began its course charged
with a fixed quantity of physical force, and this has
remained constant to the present moment, and will do
so to the end of time. By influences external to this
earth the balance of these forces is continually disturbed;
and in the effort to restore the equilibrium,
we have the production of all the varied forms of
matter, and the manifestation of each particular physical
principle or power. As motion and attraction, balanced
against each other, maintain the earth in her elliptical
orbit, so the opposition of forces determines the existence
of the amorphous rock, the light-refracting crystal, the
fixed and flowering plant, and the locomotive animal.</p>

<p>An eternal round of chemical action is displayed in
nature. Life and death are but two phases of its influences.
Growth and decay are equally the result of
its power.</p>

the simple natural scale in which air at its maximum of humidity

air absolutely deprived of moisture as = 0; the intermediate degrees
are given by the fraction 100 × actual tension of vapour ÷
tension required for the saturation of the air at its existing temperature.
Thus, if the air at any temperature whatsoever contains
vapour of half the tension, which it would contain if saturated,
the degree is 50; if three-fourths, then 75; and so forth. Air
of a higher temperature is capable of containing a greater quantity
of vapour than air of less temperature; but it is the proportion of
what it does contain, to what it would contain if saturated, which
constitutes the measure of its dryness or humidity. The capacity

doubt that the colour of watery vapour under certain circumstances
is the principal or only cause of the red colour observed in
clouds. The very fact that that colour chiefly appears in the presence
of clouds is a sufficient refutation of the only explanation
of the phenomena of sunset and sunrise, having the least plausibility,
given by optical writers. If the red light of the horizontal
sky were simply complementary to the blue of a pure atmosphere,
the sun ought to set red in the clearest weather, and then most of
all; but experience shows that a lurid sunrise or sunset is <i>always</i>
accompanied by clouds or diffused vapours, and in a great
majority of cases occurs when the changing state of previously
transparent and colourless vapour may be inferred from the succeeding
rain. In like manner, terrestrial lights seen at a distance
grow red and dim when the atmosphere is filled with vapour soon
to be precipitated. Analogy applied to the preceding observations
would certainly conduct to a solution of such appearances; for I
have remarked that the existence of vapour of high tension is by
no means essential to the production of colour, though of course a
proportionally greater thickness of the medium must be employed
to produce a similar effect when the elasticity is small.”</p></div>

<p class="p2">The influence of time, as an element, in producing
certain structural arrangements, by modifying the operations
of physical force, under whatever form it may be
exerted, has scarcely been sufficiently attended to in the
examination of cosmical phenomena. Every particle of
matter is, as it were, suspended between the agencies to
which we have been directing our attention. Under the
influences of the physical powers, sometimes exerted in
common, but often with a great preponderance in favour
of one of them, every accumulated heap of mud or sand
is slowly cohering, and assuming the form of a rock
possessing certain distinguishing features, as it regards
lamination, cleavage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The minute particles of matter are necessarily but
slightly influenced by the physical forces: their action
in accordance with the laws which determine physical
condition is manifested in an exceedingly modified
degree. But in all the operations of nature, what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[Pg 333]</span>
deficient in power is made up in time, and effects are
produced during myriads of ages, by powers far too weak
to give satisfactory results by any experiments which
might be extended even over a century.</p>

<p>If, with the eye of a geologist, we take but a cursory
glance over the Earth, we shall discover that countless
ages must have passed during the progress of this planet
to its present state. This is a fact written by the finger
of nature, in unmistakeable characters, upon the mighty
tablets of her mountains.</p>

<p>The superficial crust of the earth,&mdash;by which is meant
only that film, compared with its diameter, which is
represented by a few miles in depth&mdash;is composed of distinct
mineral masses, exhibiting peculiar physical conditions
and a certain order of arrangement. These rocks
appear to have resulted from two dissimilar causes; in
one class the action of heat is evident, and in the other
we have either the slow deposition of matter suspended
in water, or crystallization from solution; an aqueous
origin is indicated by peculiarities of formation in all the
more recent rocks.</p>

<p>There are few branches of science which admit of
speculation to the extent to which we find it carried in
geology. The consequences of this are shown in the
popular character of the science. A few observations
are made over a limited area, and certain structural conditions
are ascertained, and at once the mind, “fancy
free,” penetrates the profound depths of the earth, and
imagination, having “ample room and verge enough,”
creates causes by which every effect is to be interpreted.
Such students, generally ignorant of the first principles
of physics, knowing little of mineralogy, and less of
chemistry, to say nothing of palæontology, having none
of the requisites for an observer, boldly assume premises
which are untenable, and think they have explained a
phenomenon,&mdash;given to the world a truth,&mdash;when they
have merely promulgated an unsubstantiated specula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span>tion,
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: whieh">which</span> may have occasional marks of ingenuity, and
but little else.</p>

<p>The carefully-made observations of those who, with
unwearying industry, have traversed hill and valley,
marked and measured the various characters, thicknesses,
inclinations, and positions of rocks; who have watched
the influences of heat in changing, of water in wearing,
and the results of precipitation in forming, strata; who
have traced the mechanical effects of earthquake strugglings
and of volcanic eruptions, and, reasoning from an
immense mass of accumulated facts, deduced certain
general conclusions,&mdash;are, however, of a totally different
character; and it is such observers as these who induced
Herschel to say truly, that “geology, in the magnitude
and sublimity of the objects of which it treats, undoubtedly
ranks, in the scale of the sciences, next to
astronomy.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>The origin of this planet is involved in great obscurity,
which the powers of the most gifted are unable to penetrate.
It stands the work of an Almighty and Eternal
mind, the beginning of which we cannot comprehend,
nor can we define the period of its termination.</p>

<p>It may, probably, be safe to speculate that there was
a time when this globe consisted of only one homogeneous
stratum. Whether this remains,&mdash;whether, in
our plutonic rocks, our granites, or our porphyries, we
have any indications of the primitive state of the world,
or whether numerous changes took place before even our
unstratified formations had birth, are questions we
cannot answer. The geologist looks back into the vista
of time, and reckons, by phenomena, the progress of the
world’s mutations. The stratified formations must
have occupied thousands of ages; but before these were,
during a period extending over countless thousands, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[Pg 335]</span>
unstratified rocks may have been variously metamorphosed.
It matters not whether we admit the nebular
hypothesis or not,&mdash;a time must have been when all these
bodies which now form the mass of this globe existed in
the most simple state. We have already shown that
very remarkable changes in external character and in
chemical relations are induced, in the same simple
element, by its having been exposed to some peculiar
and different conditions; and already have we speculated
on the probability that the advance of science will enable
us to reduce the numerous elements we now reckon, to
two or three. It is, therefore, by no means an irrational
thought (which must, however, be held in the light of a
pure conjecture), to suppose that at the beginning a
mighty mass of matter, in the most attenuated state, was
produced in space, and was gradually, under the influence
of gravitation, of cohesive force, and of chemical
aggregation, moulded into the form of a sphere.
Ascending to the utmost refinement of physics, we may
suppose that this mass was of one uniform character,
and that it became in dissimilar parts&mdash;its surfaces and
towards its centre&mdash;differently constituted, under the
influences of the same powers which we now find producing,
out of the same body, charcoal and the diamond,
and creating the multitudinous forms of organized
creations. These conditions being established, and
carried to an extent of which, as yet, science has
afforded us no evidence, chemical intermixture may have
taken place, and a new series of compounds have been
formed, which, by again combining, gave rise to another
and more complex class of bodies.</p>

<p>The foundation of the superficial crust of the earth
appears to be formed of a class of rocks which have
resulted from the slow cooling of an immense mass of
heated matter. These rocks have been called <i>igneous</i>;
but are now more generally termed <i>Plutonic</i> (such as
granites, syenites, &amp;c.) Immediately above these, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>
find rocks which have resulted by deposition from
water. These masses, having been exposed to the action
of the heat below, have been considerably changed in
their character, and hence they are often called <i>metamorphic</i>;
but metamorphic rocks may, however, be of
any age. The rocks formerly termed the <i>transition</i>
series&mdash;from their forming the connecting link between
the earlier formations&mdash;are now, from the circumstance
of their being fossiliferous, classed under the general
term of palæozoic rocks, to distinguish them from the
rocks in which no organic remains have been found.
Above these are found the secondary strata, and, still
more recently produced, we have a class now usually
denominated the tertiary formations. “Eternal as the
hills” is a poetic expression, implying a long duration;
but these must, from the nature of things, eventually
pass away. The period of time necessary for the disintegration
of a granite hill is vastly beyond the powers
of computation, according to our conception of the
ordinary bounds of finite things. But a consideration
of the results of a few years,&mdash;under the influence of
the atmosphere and the rains,&mdash;as shown in quantity of
solid matter carried off by the rivers, and deposited at
their mouths, will tend to carry conviction to every
mind, that a degrading process is for ever in action on
the surface of the earth. The earth itself may be
eternal, but the surface is continually undergoing mutation,
from various causes, many of which we must
briefly consider.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>In regarding geological phenomena, the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[Pg 337]</span>
any fossil remains has often been supposed to indicate a
period previous to any organic formations. The inorganic
constituents of matter are probably of prior origin
to the organic combinations; the vessel was constructed,
upon which the organic creation was to float in space
before any vital organisms were created. The supposed
evidences in favour of the assumption that there was no
organic life during the formation of the oldest rocks we
know, are in some respects doubtful; and we can well
understand that changes may have been induced in the
earlier rock formations, by heat or by other powers, quite
sufficient to destroy all traces of organized forms. It
was long thought that phosphoric acid was not to be
detected in rocks which are regarded as of igneous origin;
and since this acid is peculiarly a constituent of organic
bodies, this has been adduced as a proof that the plutonic
rocks must have existed previously to the appearance of
vegetable or animal life upon the surface of the globe. The
researches of modern chemists have, however, shown that
phosphoric acid is to be found in formations of granitic
origin, in porphyry, basalt, and hornblende rocks.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> If,
therefore, we are to regard this substance as of organic
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: orgin">origin</span>, the rational inference is against the speculation;
but there is no more necessity for supposing phosphorus
to be formed in the animal economy than in the mineral
kingdom, from which it will probably be found the
animal obtained it.</p>

<p>Without attempting to enter into any account of the
apparent progress of life over the earth, it appears
desirable that some description should be given of the
kinds of plants and animals which we know to have
existed at different epochs. We shall thus learn, at least,
some of the prevailing characteristics of the earth during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span>
its transitions, and be in a better condition for applying
our knowledge of physical power to the explanation of
the various geological phenomena.</p>

<p>Among the earliest races we have those remarkable
forms, the trilobites, inhabiting the ancient ocean.</p>

<p>These crustacea bear some resemblance, although a
very remote one, to the common wood-louse, and, like
that animal, they had the power of rolling themselves
into a ball when attacked by an enemy. The eye of the
trilobite is a most remarkable organ; and in that of one
species, <i>Phacops caudatus</i>, not less than two hundred and
fifty lenses have been discovered. This remarkable
optical instrument indicates that these creatures lived
under similar conditions to those which surround the
crustacea of the present day.</p>

<p>At the period of the trilobites of the Silurian rocks,
all the animals contemporaneous with them had the
organs necessary for the preservation of life in the
waters.</p>

<p>Next in order of time to the trilobite, the most singular
animals inhabiting those ancient seas, whose remains
have been preserved, are the <i>Cephalopoda</i>, possessing
some traces of organs which belong to vertebrated
animals. There are numerous arms for locomotion and
prehension, arranged in a centre round the head, which
is furnished with a pair of sharp, horny mandibles,
embedded in powerful muscles. These prehensile arms
are provided with a double row of suckers, by which the
animal seized its prey. Of these cephalopodous animals
there are many varieties, but all of them appear to be
furnished with powers of rapid locomotion, and those
with shells had an hydraulic arrangement for sinking
themselves to any depth of the seas in which, without
doubt, they reigned the tyrants.</p>

<p>Passing by without notice the numerous fishes, which
appear to have exhibited a similar order of progression
to the other animals, we must proceed to the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span>
remarkable period when the dry land first began to
appear.</p>

<p>All the animals found in the strata we have mentioned
are such as would inhabit the seas; but we gradually
arrive at distinct evidence of the separation of the land
from the water, and the “green tree yielding seed”
presents itself to our attention; not that the strata
earlier than this are entirely destitute of any remains
indicating vegetable growth, but those they exhibit are
such as, in all probability, may be referred to marine
plants.</p>

<p>Those plants, however, which are found in the carboniferous
series are most of them distinguished by all
the characteristics of those which grow upon the land;
we, therefore, in the mutilated remains of vegetation left
us in our coal-formations, read the history of our early
world.</p>

<p>Then the reed-like calamite bowed its hollow and
fragile stems over the edges of the lakes the tree-ferns
grew luxuriantly in the shelter of the hills, and gave a
wild beauty to the humid valleys; the lepidodendrons
spread themselves in mighty forests along the plains,
which they covered with their curious cones; whilst the
sigillariæ extended their multitudinous branches, wreathing
like serpents amongst the luxurious vegetation, and embraced,
with their roots (stigmariæ), a most extensive
space on every side.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>The seas and lakes of this period abounded with
minute animals nearly allied to the coral animals, which
are now so actively engaged in the formation of islands
in the tropical and southern seas. During the ages
which passed by without any remarkable disturbance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span>
the surface of the earth, the many bands of mountain
limestone were formed by the ceaseless activity of these
minute architects. Encrinites (creatures in some respects
resembling star-fish) existed in vast numbers in the
oceans of this time; and the great variety of bivalve
shells, and those of a spiral character, discovered in the
rocks of this period, show the waters of the newer palæozoic
period to have been instinct with life.</p>

<p>In the world then, as it does now, water acting on
the dry land produced remarkable changes. We have
evidence of extensive districts over which the most
luxuriant vegetation must have spread for ages,&mdash;from
the remains of plants in every state of decay,&mdash;which we
find went to form our great coal-fields. These, by some
changes in the relative levels of land and water, became
covered with this fluid; and over this mass of decaying
organic matter, sand and mud were for ages being deposited.
At length, rising above the surface, it becomes
covered with vegetation, which is, after a period, submerged;
the same deposition of sand and mud again
takes place, it is once more fitted for vegetable growth,
and thus, cycle after cycle, we see the dry land and the
water changing places with each other. This will be
evident to every one who will carefully contemplate a
section of one of the coal-fields of Great Britain. We
find a stratum of coal lying upon a bed of under clay, and
above it an extensive stratum of shale or sandstone, probably
formed by the denudation of the neighbouring
hills; and in this manner we have many strata of coal,
shale, clay, ironstone, and sandstone alternating with
each other; the coal-formations of the South Wales coal-field
having the extraordinary thickness of 1500 feet.
The lowest bed of this extensive series must at one time
have been exposed as the surface of the country.</p>

<p>Ascending in the series, we have now formations of a
more recent character, in which fishes of a higher order
of organization, creeping and flying saurians, crocodiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[Pg 341]</span>
and lizards, tortoises, serpents, and frogs, are found.
The lias formations (a term corrupted from <i>layers</i>), consisting
of strata in which an argillaceous character
prevails, stand next in series. In these we have animals
preserved in a fossil state, of a distinguishingly different
character from those of the inferior strata. We meet
with extended beds of pentacrinites, some inches in
thickness; and their remains are often so very complete
that every part of the skeleton can be made out, although
so complicated that it cannot consist of less than 150,000
parts. In these formations we often find the curiously
beautiful remains of the ammonites, of which a great
variety have been discovered. Of the belemnites&mdash;animals
furnished with the shell and the ink-bag of the
cuttle-fish, with which it darkened the water to hide
itself from enemies, numerous varieties have also been
disentombed, with the ink-bag so well preserved, that
the story of the remarkable fossil has been written with
its own ink. In addition to these we find nautili; and
sixty species of extinct fishes have been described by
Agassiz from the lias of Lyme Regis alone.</p>

<p>When these rocks were in the progress of formation,
there existed the ichthyosaurus, or fish-lizard, which
appears, in many respects, to have resembled the crocodile
of the Nile. It was a predatory creature of enormous
power, and must have been the tyrant and terror
of the seas which it inhabited. Its alligator-like jaws,
its powerful eye, its fish-like fins, and turtle-like paddles,
were all formed to facilitate its progress as a destructive
minister. The plesiosaurus was, if possible, a still more
extraordinary creation. To the head of a lizard was
united an enormously long neck, a small and fish-like
body, and the tail of a crocodile: it appears formed for
existence in shallow waters, so that, when moving at
the bottom, it could lift its head above the surface for
air, or in search of its food. The flora of this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[Pg 342]</span>
must have been extensive; and it resembled the vegetation
which exists at present in Tropical regions.</p>

<p>We pass now to a new epoch, which is well distinguished
by its animals from all that had preceded
it. Races of reptiles still have place upon the earth,
and we have now the megalosaurian remains; these
animals possessing a strength and rapacity which would
render them objects of terror as well as astonishment,
could they be restored to the world which they once
ravaged. An enormous bat-like creature also existed
at this time&mdash;the pterodactyl&mdash;which, in the language
of Cuvier, was, “undoubtedly, the most extraordinary
of all the beings of whose former existence a knowledge
is granted to us, and that which, if seen alive, would
appear most unlike anything that exists in the present
world.” “You see before you,” says the same writer,
“an animal which, in all points of bony structure, from
the teeth to the extremities of the nails, presents the
well-known saurian characteristics, and of which no one
can doubt that its integuments and soft parts, its scaly
armour and its organs of circulation and reproduction,
are likewise analogous. But it was, at the same time,
an animal provided with the means of flying; and, when
stationary, its wings were probably folded back like
those of a bird, although, perhaps, by the claws attached
to its fingers, it might suspend itself from the branches
of trees.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>From the disintegration of the older rocks have no
doubt arisen those formations which are known as the
oolitic series. In these strata are preserved the remains
of plants and animals more resembling those which now
exist upon the earth; and, for the first time,&mdash;unless
the evidence of the footsteps of birds on the new red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[Pg 343]</span>
sandstone of America be accepted,&mdash;we meet with the
remains of the feathered tribes.</p>

<p>In these formations we discover animals belonging to
the class Mammalia,&mdash;the amphitherium and the phascolotherium,&mdash;which
appear to have resembled, in many
respects, the marsupial animals of New Holland.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>The wealden formations, which are the next in order
of position, are a series of clays and sands, with subordinate
beds of limestone, grit, and shale. These have,
in some instances, been formed in the sea; but they are
usually regarded as fresh-water deposits. All the older
rocks bear evident marks of marine origin, unless some
of the coal-measure strata may be regarded as otherwise;
but nearly all the wealden series contain the
remains of land, fresh-water, and estuary animals, and
of land vegetables. The creatures which we discover,
preserved, to tell the history of this period, are numerous,
and have marked peculiarities to distinguish them
from those already described, or from any now existing
on the earth. We find land saurians of a large kind,
and animals of all sizes; even insects, of which a great
variety are found in the wealds. The remarkable
iguanodon was an animal which, even by the cautious
measurement of Professor Owen, must have been at
least twenty-eight feet long; and this enormous creature
was suspected, by Cuvier, and has been proved by Owen,
to have been an “herbivorous saurian for terrestrial
life.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Dr. Mantell calculates that no less than seventy
individuals of the iguanodon of all ages have come
under his notice; and the bones of a vast number of
others must have been broken up by the workmen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[Pg 344]</span>
the few quarries of Tilgate grit; so that these creatures
were by no means rare at the period of their existence.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>The uppermost of these secondary formations is the
cretaceous or chalk group, which spreads over a large
portion of south-eastern England, and is met with in all
parts of Europe. This chalk, which is a carbonate of
lime, appears to have been slowly precipitated from
tranquil water, as, according to Sir Henry De la Beche,
organic remains are beautifully preserved in it. Substances
of no greater solidity than common sponges
retain their forms, delicate shells remain unbroken, fish
even are frequently not flattened, and altogether we
have the appearances which justify us in concluding
that, since these organic exuviæ were entombed, they
have been protected from pressure by the consolidation
of the rock around them.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Beneath the chalk exists what has been called, from
its colour&mdash;derived from a silicate of the protoxide of
iron,&mdash;green sand, and was, no doubt, formed by deposition
from the same water in which the carbonate of
lime was suspended,&mdash;the green sand falling to the
bottom more readily from its greater specific gravity.
“The tranquillity,” observes Sir Henry De la Beche,
“which seems to have prevailed during this great
accumulation of siliceo-calcareous matter, whether it
may have been a deposit from water, in which it was
mechanically suspended, partly the work of living
creatures, or in a great measure chemical, is very
remarkable.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>In the chalk, the remains of the leaves of dicotyledonous
plants and fragments of wood are found more
abundantly than in the earlier strata, many of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>
are marked with the perforations of marine worms,
indicating that they had floated for some time in the
ocean. It should, however, be remembered, that these
are not the first indications of vegetable life,&mdash;leaves
have been found in the new red sandstone; and the
flora of the coal formation must not be forgotten. The
manner in which silica has deposited itself on organic
bodies&mdash;such as the sponges&mdash;is curious; the whole of
the organized tissue being often removed, and flint
having taken its place. Flints formed by such a process
as this abound in the upper chalk. The association of
carbon and silicon, combined with oxygen, as we find
them in the cretaceous formations, is most interesting,
and naturally gives rise to some speculation on the
relation of these two elements. Both carbon and
silicon, as has been already shown, exist in several allotropic
conditions; and, although the statements
made by Dr. Brown relative to the conversion of carbon
into silicon are proved to be grounded on experimental
error, it is not improbable that a very intimate relation
may exist between these elements.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The probability is,
that the sponge animal has the power of secreting silica
to give strength to its form. “Many species,” says
Rymer Jones, speaking of recent sponges, “exhibiting
the same porous structure, have none of the elasticity of
the officinal sponge&mdash;a circumstance which is due to the
difference observable in the composition of their
skeletons or ramified frame-work. In such the living
crust forms within its substance not only tenacious
bands of animal matter, but great quantities of crystal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span>lized
spicula, sometimes of a calcareous, at others of a
siliceous, nature.” Thus, a frame of siliceous matter
being formed by the living animal, a deposition of the
same substance is continued after death.</p>

<p>Sea-urchins and star-fish, and numerous fossil shells,
are found in these beds, which, however, differ materially
from the remains of the same animals found in the
earlier formations. A vast number of new species and
genera of fish are also discovered in the chalk.</p>

<p>Nearly all the animals and plants which existed up to
this period are now extinct, although they have some
imperfect representatives at the present day.</p>

<p>The uppermost group, which has been called the
supercretaceous or tertiary formation, appears in our
island to have been formed during four great eras, as
we find fresh-water deposits alternating with marine
ones. The term <i>eocene</i>, which is the first or oldest
deposit; <i>miocene</i>, which is the second; <i>pliocene</i>, which
is the third; and the <i>newer pliocene</i>,&mdash;which is the fourth
and last, have been applied to these formations, the
names referring to the respective proportions of existing
species found among their fossil shells.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>All these formations show distinct evidence of their
having been deposited from still or slowly-flowing deep
waters. Thus the eocene appears in the Paris basin,&mdash;formed
clearly at an estuary, in which are mingled some
interesting fresh-water deposits;&mdash;in the lacustrine
formations in Auvergne; also at Aix; and in the north
of Italy. It appears probable that, in the formations
generally termed eocene, both fresh-water and marine
deposits have been confounded, and several formations
of widely-different eras regarded as the result of one.
We have not yet been furnished with any distinct and
clear evidence to show that the deposits of the Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>[Pg 347]</span>
basin, and those of Auvergne, are of the same age.
At all events, it is sufficient for our present purpose to
know that they are the result of actions which are now
as general as they were when the plastic clay of Paris,
and its sulphate of lime, or the London clay, were slowly
deposited.</p>

<p>As a general conclusion, we may decide that, at the
eocene period, existing continents were the sites of vast
lakes, rivers, and estuaries, and were inhabited by quadrupeds,
which lived upon their thickly-wooded margins.
Many remains, allied to those of the hippopotamus, have
been found in the subsidences of this period.</p>

<p>Examples of the miocene or middle tertiary era are
to be found in Western France, over the whole of the
great valley of Switzerland, and the valley of the Danube.
In these deposits we find the bones of the rhinoceros,
elephant, hippopotamus, and the dinotherium, an extinct
animal, possessing many very distinguishing features.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>The pliocene period has been termed the age of
elephants, and is most remarkable for the great mastodons
and gigantic elks, with other animals not very
unlike those which are contemporaneous with man.</p>

<p>In the superficial layers of the earth, the diluvium,
alluvium, peat and vegetable soil, we have a continuation
of the history of the mutations of our globe and of its
inhabitants, which has been here so briefly sketched. They
bring us up to the period when man appeared in the
world, since whose creation it is evident no very extensive
change has been produced upon the surface. We
have viewed the phenomena of each great epoch, marked
as they are by new creations of organized beings, and it
would appear as if, through the whole series, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[Pg 348]</span>
primary rocks up to the modern alluvial deposits, a progressive
improvement of the earth’s surface had been
effected, to fit it at last for the abode of the human
race.</p>

<p>Thus have we preserved for us, in a natural manner,
evidences which, if we read them aright, must convince
us that the laws by which creation has ever been regulated
are as constant and unvarying as the Eternal mind
by which they are decreed. Our earth, we find, by the
records preserved in the foundation-stones of her mountains,
has existed through countless ages, and through
them all exhibited the same active energies that prevail
at the present moment. By precisely similar influences
to those now in operation, have rocks been formed,
which, under like agencies, have been covered with
vegetation, and sported over by, to us, strange varieties
of animal life. Every plant that has grown upon the
earliest rocks which presented their faces to the life-giving
sun, has had its influence on the subsequent
changes of our planet. Each trilobite, each saurian,
and every one of the mammalia which exist in the fossil
state, have been small laboratories in which the great
work of eternal change has been carried forward, and,
under the compulsion of the strong laws of creation,
they have been made ministers to the great end of forming
a world which might be fitting for the presence of a
creature endued with a spark taken from the celestial
flame of intellectual life.</p>

<p>For a few moments we will return to a consideration
of the operations at present exhibiting their phenomena,
and examine what bearing they have upon our knowledge
of geological formations.</p>

<p>During periods of immense, but unknown, duration,
the ocean and the dry land are seen to have changed
their places. Enormous deposits, formed at the bottom
of the sea, are lifted by some mechanical, probably
volcanic, force, above the waters, and the land, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[Pg 349]</span>
ocean surrounding it, teems with life. This state of
things lasts for ages; but the time arrives when the
ocean again floods the land, and a new state of things,
over a particular district, has a beginning.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the changes which we have
spoken of, as if they were the result of slow decay and
gradual deposit, were effected without occasional violent
convulsions. Many of the strata which were evidently
deposited at the bottom of the sea, and, of course, as
horizontal beds, are now found nearly vertical. We
have evidence of strata of immense thickness having
been subjected to forces that have twisted and contorted
them in a most remarkable manner. Masses of solid
rock, many thousand feet deep, are frequently bent and
fractured throughout their whole extent. Mountains
have been upheaved by internal force, and immense
districts have suddenly sunk far below their usual level.
By the expansive force due to that temperature which
must be required to melt basaltic and trap rocks, the
whole of the superficial crust of a country has been
heaved to a great height, immense fissures have been
formed by the breaking of the mass, and the melted
matter has been forced through the opening, and overflowed
extensive districts, or volcanoes have been formed,
and wide areas have been buried under the ashes ejected
from them. With the cause of these convulsions we
are at present unacquainted.</p>

<p>We have evidence of the extent to which these forces
may be exerted, in the catastrophes which have occurred
within historical times, and which have happened even
in our own day. Herculaneum and Pompeii, buried
under the lava and ashes of Vesuvius, in an hour when
the inhabitants of these cities were unprepared for such
a fearful visitation,&mdash;the frightful earthquakes which
have, from time to time, occurred in South America&mdash;are
evidences of the existence of hidden forces which
shake the firm-set earth. Similar ravaging catastrophes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[Pg 350]</span>
may have often occurred, and, involving cataclysms,
swept the surface to produce the changes we detect over
every part of the earth, compared with which the earthquakes
and floods of history are but trivial things.
Evidence has been adduced, to show that the mountains
of the Old World may have approached in height the
highest of the Andes or Himalayas, and these have not
been destroyed by any sudden effect, but by the slow
disintegrating action of the elements.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> All these
phenomena are now in progress: the winds and the
rains wear the faces of the exposed rock; their <i>débris</i>,
mixed with decayed vegetable and animal matter, are
washed off from the surface, and borne away by the
rivers, to be deposited in the seas. Thus it is that the
great delta of the Ganges is formed, and that a continual
increase of matter is going on at the mouths of rivers.
The Amazon, the Mississippi, and other great rivers,
bear into the ocean, daily, thousands of tons of matter
from the surface of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> This is, of course, de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[Pg 351]</span>posited
at the bottom of the sea, and it must, in the
process of time, alter the relative levels of the ocean
and the land. Islands have been lifted by volcanic
power from the bottom of the sea, and many districts
in South America have been depressed by the same
causes.</p>

<p>Changes as extensive have been, in all probability,
effected by forces “equally or more powerful, but acting
with less irregularity, and so distributed over time as to
produce none of those interregnums of chaotic anarchy
which we are apt to think (perhaps erroneously) great
disfigurements of an order so beautiful and harmonious
as that of nature.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> These forces are, without doubt,
even now in action.</p>

<p>Had it not been for these convulsive disturbances of the
surface, the earth would have presented an almost uniform
plain, and it would have been ill-adapted for the
abode of man. The hills raised by the disturbances of
nature, and the valleys worn by the storms of ages,
minister especially to his wants, and afford him the
means of enjoyment which he could not possess had the
surface been otherwise formed. The “iced mountain
tops,” condensing the clouds which pass over them, send
down healthful streams to the valleys, and supply the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>[Pg 352]</span>
springs of the earth, thus securing the fertility and
salubrity of the distant plains. The severities of climate
are mitigated by these conditions, and both the people
of the tropics and those dwelling near the poles are
equally benefited by them.</p>

<p>Gravitation, cohesion, motion, chemical force, heat,
and electricity, must, from that hypothetical time when
the earth floated a cloud of nebulous vapour, in a state
of gradual condensation up to the present moment, have
been exercising their powers, and regulating the mutations
of matter.</p>

<p>When the dry land was beneath the waters, and when
darkness was upon the face of the deep, the same great
operations as those which are now in progress in the
depths of the Atlantic, or in the still waters of our
inland lakes, were in full activity. At length the dry
land appears; and&mdash;mystery of mysteries&mdash;it soon
becomes teeming with life in all the forms of vegetable
and animal beauty, under the aspect of the beams of a
glorious sun.</p>

<p>Geology teaches us to regard our position upon the
earth as one far in advance of all former creations. It
bids us look back through the enormous vista of time,
and see, shining still in the remotest distance, the light
which exposes to our vision many of nature’s holy
wonders. The elements which now make up this
strangely beautiful fabric of muscle, nerves, and bone,
have passed through many ordeals, ere yet it became
fashioned to hold the human soul. No grain of matter
has been added to the planet, since it was weighed in a
balance, and poised with other worlds. No grain of
matter can be removed from it. But in virtue of those
forces which seem to originate in the sun, “the soul of
the great earth,” a succession of new forms has been
produced, as the old things have passed away.</p>

<p>Under the forces we have been considering, acting as
so many contending armies, matter passes from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>[Pg 353]</span>
condition to another, and what is now a living and a
breathing creature, or a delicate and sweetly-scented
flower, has been a portion of the amorphous mass which
once lay in the darkness of the deep ocean, and it will
again, in the progress of time, pass into that condition
where no evidences of organization can be found,&mdash;again,
perhaps, to arise clothed with more exalted powers than
even man enjoys.</p>

<p>When man places himself in contrast with the Intelligences
beyond him, he feels his weakness; and the
extent of power which he can discover at work, guided
by a mysterious law, is such, that he is dwarfed by its
immensity. But looking on the past, surveying the
progress of matter through the inorganic forms up to
the higher organizations, until at length man stands
revealed as the chief figure in the foreground of the
picture, the monarch of a world on which such elaborate
care has been bestowed, and the absolute ruler of all
things around him, he rises like a giant in the conscious
strength of his far-searching mind. That so great,
so noble a being, should suffer himself to be degraded by
the sensualities of life to a level with the creeping things,
upon which he has the power to tread, is a lamentable
spectacle, over which angels must weep.</p>

<p>The curious connection between the superstitions of
races, the traditionary tales of remote tribes, and the
developments of the truths of science, are often of a
very marked character, and they cannot but be regarded
as instructive. In the wonders of “olden time” fiction
has ever delighted; and a thousand pictures have been
produced of a period when beings lived and breathed
upon the earth which have no existence now.</p>

<p>Hydras, harpies, and sea-monsters, figure in the myths
of antiquity. In the mythology of the northern races
of Europe we have fiery flying dragons, and Poetry has
placed these as the guardians of the “hoarded spirit”
and protectors of the enchanted gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>Through the whole of the romance period of European
literature, nothing figures but serpents, “white and
red,” toiling and fighting underground,&mdash;thus producing
earthquakes, as in the story of Merlin and the building
of Stonehenge. Flying monsters, griffins and others,
which now live only in the meaningless embellishments
of heraldry, appear to have been conceived by the earlier
races of men as the representatives of power. Curious
is it, too, to find the same class of ideas prevailing in
the East. The monster dragons of the Chinese, blazoned
on their standards and ornamenting their temples;&mdash;the
Buddaical superstition that the world is supported
on a vast elephant, which stands on the back of a tortoise,
which again rests on a serpent, whose movements
produce earthquakes and violent convulsions;&mdash;the rude
decorations also of the temples of the Aztecs, which
have been so recently restored to our knowledge by the
adventurous travellers of Central America,&mdash;all give
expression to the same mythological idea.</p>

<p>Do not these indicate a faint and shadowy knowledge
of a previous state of organic existence? The process
of communion between man of the present, and the
creations of a former world, we know not; it is
mysterious, and for ever lost to us. But even the most
ignorant and uncultivated races of mankind have figured
for themselves the images of creatures which, whilst
they do really bear some resemblance to things which
have for ever passed away, do not, in the remotest
degree, partake of any of the peculiarities of existing
creations.</p>

<p>The ichthyosaurus, and the plesiosaurus, and the
pterodactylus, are preserved in the rude images of
harpies, of dragons, and of griffins; and, although the
idea of an elephant standing on the back of a tortoise
was often laughed at as an absurdity, Captain Cautley
and Dr. Falconer at length discovered in the hills of
Asia the remains of a tortoise in a fossil state of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>[Pg 355]</span>
size that an elephant could easily have performed the
feat.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>Of the ammonites, we have more exact evidence;
they were observed by our forefathers, and called by
them snake-stones. According to the legends of Catholic
saints they were considered as possessing a sacred
character:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Of these and snakes, each one</div>
<div class="verse">Was changed into a coil of stone</div>
<div class="verse">When holy Hilda prayed.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And in addition to this petrifying process, one of
decapitation is said to have been effected; hence the
reason why these <i>snake-stones</i> have no heads.</p>

<p>We also find, in the northern districts of our island,
that the name of “St. Cuthbert’s beads” is applied to
the fossil remains of encrinites.</p>

<p>Thus we learn that, to a great extent, fiction is
dependent upon truth for its creations; and we see that
when we come to investigate any wide-spread popular
superstition, although much distorted by the medium of
error through which it has passed, it is frequently
founded upon some fragmentary truth. There are floating
in the minds of men certain ideas which are not the
result of any associations drawn from things around;
we reckon them amongst the mysteries of our being.
May they not be the truths of a former world, of which
we receive the dim outshadowing in the present, like the
faint lights of a distant Pharos, seen through the mists
of the wide ocean?</p>

<p>Man treads upon the wreck of antiquity. In times
which are so long past, that the years between them
cannot be numbered by the aids of our science, geology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>[Pg 356]</span>
teaches us that forms of life existed perfectly fitted for
the conditions of the period. These performed their
offices in the great work; they passed away, and others
succeeded to carry on the process of building a world
for man. The past preaches to the present, and from
its marvellous discourses we venture to infer something
of the yet unveiled future. The forces which have
worked still labour: the phenomena which they have
produced will be repeated.</p>

with detritus, would flow over sea-water, will depend upon a variety
of obvious circumstances. Captain Sabine found discoloured water,
supposed to be that of the Amazons, three hundred miles distant
in the ocean from the embouchure of that river. It was about
126 feet deep. Its specific gravity was = 1·0204, and the specific
gravity of the sea-water = 1·0262. This appears to be the
greatest distance from land at which river water has been detected
on the surface of the ocean. If rivers, containing mechanically
suspended detritus, flowed over sea-water in lines which, in general
terms, might be called straight, the deposit of transported matter
which they carried out would also be in straight lines. If,
however, they be turned aside by an ocean current, as was the
case with that observed by Captain Sabine, the detritus would be
thrown, and cover an area corresponding in a great degree with
the sweep which the river has been compelled to make out of the
course, that its impulse, when discharged from its embouchure,
might lead it to take: supposing the velocity with which this river-water
was moving has been correctly estimated at about three
miles per hour, it is not a little curious to consider that the agitation
and resistance of its particles should be sufficient to keep
finely comminuted solid matter mechanically suspended, so that it
would not be disposed freely to part with it, except at its junction
with the sea-water over which it flows, and where, from friction,
it is sufficiently retarded. So that a river, if it can preserve a
given amount of velocity flowing over the sea, may deposit no
very large amount of mechanically suspended detritus in its course
from the embouchure, where it is ultimately stopped. Still, however,
though the deposit may not be so abundant as at first sight
would appear probable, the constant accumulation of matter, however
inconsiderable at any given time, must produce an appreciable
effect during the lapse of ages.”&mdash;Sir Henry De la Beche’s <i>Geological
Researches</i>, p. 72.</p></div>

<p class="p2">The variety of beautiful forms which cover the surface
of this sphere, serve, beyond the physical purposes to
which we have already alluded, to influence the mind,
and give character to the inhabitants of every locality.
There are men who appear to be dead to the mild
influences of flowers; but these sweet blossoms&mdash;the
stars of our earth&mdash;exert a power as diffusive as their
pervading odours.</p>

<p>The poet tells us of a man to whom</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The primrose on the river’s brim</div>
<div class="verse">A yellow primrose was to him,</div>
<div class="verse">And it was nothing more.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it was something more. He, perhaps, attended not
to the eloquent teaching of its pure, pale leaves: he
might not have been conscious of the mysterious singing
of that lowly flower: he might, perchance, have crushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>[Pg 358]</span>
it beneath his rude foot rather than quaff the draught
of wisdom which it secreted in its cell; but the flower
still ministered to that mere sensualist, and in its
strange, tongueless manner, reproved his passions, and
kept him “a wiser and a better man,“ than if it
had pleased God to have left the world without the
lovely primrose.</p>

<p>The psychology of flowers has found many students&mdash;than
whom not one read them more deeply than that
mild spirit who sang of the Sensitive Plant, and in
wondrous music foreshadowed his own melancholy
fate.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> That martyr to sensibility, Keats, who longed to
feel the flowers growing above him, drew the strong
inspiration of his volant muse from those delicate
creations which exhibit the passage of inorganic matter
into life; and other poets will have their sensibilities
awakened by the æsthetics of flowers, and find a mirror
of truth in the crystal dew-drop which clings so lovingly
to the purple violet, and draws fresh beauties from its
coloured petals.</p>

<p>If we examine carefully all the conditions of matter
which we have made the subject of our studies, we
cannot but perceive how gradual is the progress of the
involved action of the physical forces, as we advance
from the molecule&mdash;the mere particle of matter&mdash;up to
the organic combination. At first we detect only the
action of cohesion in forming the rude mass; then we
have the influence of the crystallogenic powers giving
a remarkable regularity to bodies; we next discover the
influences of heat and electrical force in determining
condition, and of chemical action as controlled by them.
Yet, still we have a body without organization. Light
exerts its mysterious powers, and the same elements
assume an organized form; and, in addition to the
recognized agencies, we dimly perceive others on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>[Pg 359]</span>
vitality evidently depends. These empyreal influences
become more and more complicated to us: ascending in
the scale, they rise beyond our science; and, at length,
we find them guiding the power of intelligence, while
instinct and reason are exhibited in immediate dependence
upon them.</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined that this view has any tendency
to materialism. The vital energy is regarded as a
spiritualization, and reason as a divine emanation; but
they are connected with materialities, on which they
act, and by which they are themselves controlled. The
organic combinations, and the physical powers by which
these unions of matter are effected and retained, have a
direct action over that ethereality which is life, and the
powers of life again control these more material forces.
The spirit, in whatever state, when connected with matter,
is, like Prometheus chained to his rock, in a constant
struggle to escape from its shackles, and assert the full
power of its divine strength.</p>

<p>We have seen variety enough in the substances which
make up the inorganic part of creation; but infinitely
more varied are the forms of organization. In the
vegetable world which is immediately around us, from
the green slime of our marshes to the lustrous flowers
of our gardens and the lordly trees of our forests, what
an extraordinary diversity of form is apparent! From
the infusoria of an hour, to the gigantic elephant roaming
in his greatness in the forests of Siam&mdash;the noble
lion of the caves of Senegal&mdash;the mighty condor of the
Andes&mdash;and onward to man, the monarch of them all,
how vast are the differences, and yet how complete are
they in their respective conditions! In the creation we
have examined, we have had conclusive evidence, that
from the combination of <i>atoms</i> every peculiar form has
been produced. In the creation we are about to
examine, we shall discover that all the immense diversity
of form, of colour, and condition which is spread over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>[Pg 360]</span>
the world in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, results
from the combination of <i>cells</i>. The atom of inorganic
nature becomes a cell in organic creation. This cell
must be regarded as the compound radical of the chemist,
and by decomposing it, we destroy the essential element
of organization.</p>

<p>With the mysterious process by which the atom is
converted into a cell, or a compound radical, we are unacquainted;
but we must regard the cell as the organic
atom. It is in vain that the chemist or the physiologist
attempts to examine this change of the inorganic elements
to an organized state; it is one of the mysteries of
creation, which is to be, in all probability, hid from our
eyes, until this “mortal coil” is shaken off, and we
enjoy the full powers of that intelligence which we
are promised we shall enjoy in an immortal state.</p>

<p>Again and again has the attention of men been
attracted to the <i>generatio æquivoca</i>; they have sometimes
thought they have discovered a <i>generatio primitiva</i>
or <i>spontanea</i>; but a more careful examination of these
organisms has shown that an embryo existed&mdash;a real
germination has taken place.</p>

<p>Count Rumford<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> stated that threads of silk and
wool had the power of decomposing carbonic acid
in water in the sunshine; and hence some have referred
organization to a mere chemical change produced
by luminous excitation; and we have heard of
animal life resulting from pounded siliceous matter. All
such statements must be regarded as evidences of imperfect
investigation.</p>

<p>Dr. Carus, alluding to the experiments of Gruithuisen,
Priestley, and Ingenhousz,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> says:&mdash;“These show, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>[Pg 361]</span>
than any other experiments, that, in the purest water,
under the influence of air, light, and heat, beings are
formed, which, oscillating as it were between the animal
and the plant, exhibit the primitive germs of both kingdoms.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
Treviranus<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> repeated, and appeared to confirm
these results; but in these experiments we have no
evidence that the germ did not previously exist in the
spring-water which was employed.</p>

<p>Some have regarded the cell as a crystal; they see
the crystal forming, by the accumulation of atoms, into
a fixed form, under the influence of an “inner life;”
and, advancing but a step, they regard the cell as the
result of an increased exercise of the physical influences.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
We have referred crystalline form to certain
magnetic conditions; and it is evident that the atomic
cell is influenced by similar forces; but if we place a
crystal in its natural fluid, though it increases in size, it
never alters in form: whereas, if we examine a cell in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>[Pg 362]</span>
its natural position, it gives indications of motion, it
produces other cells, and we have a development of
organs which are in no respect the same in form as
the original. From a vesicle floating invisible to
the unaided human sense in its womb of fluid, is produced
a plant possessing strange powers, or an animal
gifted with volition. The idea, that two kinds of
polarity&mdash;light on one side, and gravitation on the
other&mdash;produce the two peculiar developments of roots
and branches, can only be regarded as one of those
fanciful analogies which prove more imagination than
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The conditions are, however, most curious; they deserve
very attentive study; but in examining the phenomena,
the safest course is to allow the effects as they
arise to interpret to us, and not admit the love of hypothesis
to lead us into bewildering analogies; or uncertain
phenomena to betray us to hasty inferences. It is of this
evil that Bacon speaks, in his “Advancement of Learning.”
He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The root of this error, as of all others, is this,
that men, in their contemplations of nature, are
accustomed to make too timely a departure, and too
remote a recess from experience and particulars,
and have yielded and resigned themselves over to
the fumes of their own fancies and popular argumentations.”</p>

<p>Without venturing, therefore, to speculate on the
origin of the primitive cell, or unit of organic life, which
involves the problem of the metamorphosis of a rude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>[Pg 363]</span>
mass&mdash;the primitive transformation of the rudimentary
atoms into organic form,&mdash;we must admit that the
highly organized plant or animal is but an aggregation
of cells; their arrangement being dependent upon
certain properties peculiar to them, and the exercise of
forces such as we have been studying,&mdash;all of which
appear to act externally to the plant or animal itself.</p>

<p>Experiments have been brought forward, in which
it appeared that, after all organization which could by
any possibility have existed, had been destroyed by the
action of fire, solutions of flint and metallic salts,
have, under the influence of electric currents, exhibited
signs of organic formations, and that, indeed, insects&mdash;a
species of acari&mdash;have been developed in them. The
experiments were said to have been made with care, and
many precautions taken to shut out all chances of any
error, but not all the precautions required in a matter of
such exceeding delicacy; and we are bound not to
receive the evidence afforded as the true expression of a
fact without much further investigation. All experience,&mdash;setting
aside the experiment named,&mdash;is against the
supposition that pounded or dissolved flint could by any
artificial means be awakened into life. Ova may
have been conveyed into the vessels which contained
the solutions under experiment; and in due time,
although possibly quickened by electric excitation,
the animals&mdash;the most common of insects&mdash;came into
existence.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>The rapid growth of confervæ upon water has often
been brought forward as evidence of a spontaneous
generation, or the conversion of inorganic elements into
organic forms; but it has been most satisfactorily proved
that the germ must be present, otherwise no evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>[Pg 364]</span>
anything like organization will be developed. All the
conditions required for the production of vegetable life
appear to show, that it is quite impossible for any kind
of plant, even the very lowest in the scale, to be formed
in any other way than from an embryo in which are
contained the elements necessary for it, and the arrangements
required for the various processes which are connected
with its vitality.</p>

<p>The earth is now covered with vegetable life, but
there must have existed a time when “darkness was
upon the face of the deep,” and organization had not
yet commenced tracing its lovely net-work of cells upon
the bare surface of the ocean-buried rock. At length
the mystery of organic creation began: into this
science dares not penetrate, but it is privileged to begin
its search a little beyond this point, and we are
enabled to trace the progress of organic development
through a chain of interesting results which are constantly
recurring.</p>

<p>If we take some water, rising from a subterranean
spring, and expose it to sunshine, we shall see, after a
few days, a curious formation of bubbles, and the
gradual accumulation of green matter. At first we
cannot detect any marks of organization&mdash;it appears a
slimy cloud of an irregular and undetermined form.
It slowly aggregates, and forms a sort of mat over the
surface, which at the same time assumes a darker green
colour. Careful examination will now show the original
corpuscles involved in a net-work formed by slender
threads, which are tubes of circulation, and may be
traced from small points which we must regard as the
compound atom, the vegetable unit. We must not
forget, here, that we have to deal with four chemical
elements,&mdash;oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen,
which compose the world of organized forms, and that
the water affords us the two first as its constituents,
gives us carbon in the form of carbonic acid dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>[Pg 365]</span>
in it, and that nitrogen is in the air surrounding it, and
frequently mixed with it also.</p>

<p>Under the influence of sunshine, we have now seen
these elements uniting into a mysterious bond, and the
result is the formation of a cellular tissue, which possesses
many of the functions of the noblest specimens of
vegetable growth. But let us examine the progress.
The bare surface of a rock rises above the waters
covered over with this green slime, a mere veil of delicate
net-work, which, drying off, leaves no perceptible
trace behind it; but the basis of a mighty growth is
there, and under solar influence, in the process of time,
other changes occur.</p>

<p>After a period, if we examine the rock, we shall find
upon its face little coloured cups or lines with small
hard discs. These, at first sight, would not be taken for
plants, but on close examination they will be found to be
lichens. These minute vegetables shed their seed and
die, and from their own remains a more numerous crop
springs into life. After a few of these changes, a sufficient
depth of soil is formed, upon which mosses begin to
develope themselves, and give to the stone a second
time a faint tint of green, a mere film still, but indicating
the presence of a beautiful class of plants, which, under
the microscope, exhibit in their leaves and flowers many
points of singular elegance. These mosses, like the
lichens, decaying, increase the film of soil, and others of
a larger growth supply their places, and run themselves
the same round of growth and decay. By and by,
funguses of various kinds mingle their little globes and
umbrella-like forms. Season after season plants, perish
and add to the soil, which is at the same time increased
in depth by the disintegration of the rock over which
it is laid, the cohesion of particles being broken up by
the operations of vegetable life. The minute seeds of
the ferns floating on the breeze, now find a sufficient
depth of earth for germination, and their beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>[Pg 366]</span>
fronds, eventually, wave in loveliness to the passing
winds.</p>

<p>Vegetable forms of a higher and a higher order
gradually succeed each other, each series perishing in
due season, and giving to the soil additional elements
for the growth of plants of their own species or those of
others. Flowering herbs find a genial home on the
once bare rock; and the primrose pale, the purple foxglove,
or the gaudy poppy, open their flowers to the joy
of light. The shrub, with its hardy roots interlaced
through the soil, and binding the very stones, grows
rich in its bright greenery. Eventually the tree springs
from the soil, and where once the tempest beat on the
bare cold rock, is now the lordly and branching monarch
of the forest, with its thousand leaves, affording shelter
from the storm for bird and beast.</p>

<p>Such are the conditions which prevail throughout
nature in the progress of vegetable growth; the green
matter gathering on a pond, the mildew accumulating
on a shaded wall, being the commencement of a process
which is to end in the development of the giant trees of
the forest, and the beautifully tinted flower of nature’s
most chosen spot.</p>

<p>We must now consider closely the phenomena connected
with the growth of an individual plant, which
will illustrate the operation of physical influences
throughout the vegetable world. The process by which
the embryo, secured in the seed, is developed, is our
first inquiry.</p>

<p>A seed is a highly carbonized body, consisting of
integuments and embryo: between these, in most seeds,
lies a substance called the <i>albumen</i>, or <i>perisperm</i>. The
embryo contains the elements of the future plant&mdash;the
cotyledons, the plumule, and the radicle; the former
developing into stalk and leaves, the latter into roots.
This embryo hides the living principle, for the development
of which it is necessary that the starch and gluten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>[Pg 367]</span>
undergo a chemical change, and that an elevation of
temperature is produced. The vital power is dormant&mdash;it
sleeps&mdash;in the seed until the proper conditions are
produced. It has been proved, that the powers of
maintaining life in the seed are very great; excessive
cold, sufficiently intense to freeze mercury, will not kill
seed, and they resist a comparatively high temperature.
It is probable that heat only destroys seeds by drying
them too completely. The temperature at which
seeds germinate is exceedingly varied,&mdash;those belonging
to our own clime will germinate when the thermometer
rises above 40° F., but the seeds of tropical plants
demand that a temperature of from 70° to 84°, or even
to 90°, be steadily applied to them. In some cases it
has been found that even boiling the seeds has been
advantageous to the future process of germination in
the soil. But let us take the seed of some ordinary
plant, and trace its progress.</p>

<p>An apparently dead grain is placed in the soil. If
the temperature is a few degrees above the freezing point,
and the soil holds a due quantity of water, the integument
of the seed imbibes moisture and swells; the tissue is
softened, and the first effort of vital force begins. The
seed has now the power of decomposing water, the
oxygen combines with some of the carbon of the seed,
and is expelled as carbonic acid. Saussure’s experiments
prove this. The air above the soil in which a horse-bean
was placed to germinate, gave, before the experiment,
nitrogen 210·26, and oxygen 56·29, and after
germination, nitrogen 209·41, oxygen 44·38, and carbonic
acid 11·27. This part of the process is but little
removed from the merely chemical changes which we
have already considered. We find the starch of the
seed changed into gum and sugar, which affords nutritive
food for the developing embryo. The seed now
lengthens downwards by the radicle, and upwards by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>[Pg 368]</span>
the cotyledons, which, as they rise above the earth,
acquire a green colour. Here the first stage of vegetable
life ends, the chemically exciting process is at an
end, and a new stimulus is required to continue in full
activity the vital powers. Carbonic acid is no longer
given off.</p>

<p>The cotyledons, which are two opposite roundish
leaves, act as the lungs; by them carbonic acid taken
from the atmosphere is absorbed and carried by a circulating
process, now in full activity, through the young
plant. The carbonic acid, a compound of carbon and
oxygen, is decomposed; it is deprived of its carbon, which
is retained by the plant, and oxygen is exhaled. The
plant at this period is little more than an arrangement
of cellular tissue, a very slight development of vascular
and fibrous tissue appearing as a cylinder lying in the
centre of the sheath. At this point, however, we begin
more distinctly to trace the operations of the new
power; the impulses of life are strikingly evident.</p>

<p>The young root is now lengthening, and absorbing
from the moisture in the soil, which always contains
some soluble salts, a portion of its nutriment, which is
impelled upwards by a force&mdash;probably capillary attraction
and endosmose action combined&mdash;to the point from
which the plumule springs. Capillary force raises the
fluids through the tubes in the stalk, and conveys
them to the veins in the leaves, while the endosmose
force diffuses them through the vegetable tissues. The
plumule first ascends as a little twig, and, at the same time,
by exerting a more energetic action on the carbonic
acid than the cotyledons have done, the carbon retained
by them being only so much as is necessary to form
chlorophylle, or the green colouring matter of leaves,
some wood is deposited in the centre of the radicle.
From this time the process of lignification goes on
through all the fabric,&mdash;the increase, and indeed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>[Pg 369]</span>
life, of the plant depending upon the development of a
true leaf from the plumule.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the process consists, in
the first place, of a mere oxidation of the carbon in the
seed,&mdash;a slow combustion by which the spark of life is
to be kindled;&mdash;the hydrogen of the water plays an
important part, and, combining also with the carbon,
forms necessary compounds, and by a secondary process
gives rise again to water by combination with
oxygen in the cells of the germinating grain. Nor
must we regard the second class of phenomena as mere
mechanical processes for decomposing carbonic acid, but
the result of the combined influences of all the physical
powers and life superadded.</p>

<p>This elongating little twig, the plumule, at length
unfolds itself, and the branch is metamorphosed into a
leaf. The leaf aërates the sap it receives, effects the
decomposition of the carbonic acid, the water, and in all
probability the ammonia which it derives from the air,
and thus returns to the pores, which communicate with
the pneumatic arrangements of the plant, the necessary
secretions for the formation of bark, wood, and the
various proximate principles which it contains.</p>

<p>After the first formation of a leaf, others successively
appear, all constructed alike, and performing similar
functions. The leaf is the principal organ to the tree;
and, indeed, Linnæus divined, and Goethe demonstrated,
the beautiful fact, that the tree was developed from this
curiously-formed organ.</p>

<p>“Keeping in view,” says the poet-philosopher, “the
observations that have been made, there will be no
difficulty in discovering the leaf in the seed-vessel, notwithstanding
the variable structure of that part and its
peculiar combinations. Thus the pod is a leaf which is
folded up and grown together at its edges, and the capsules
consist of several leaves grown together, and the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a>[Pg 370]</span>pound
fruit is composed of several leaves united round
a common centre, their sides being opened so as to
form a communication between them, and their edges
adhering together. This is obvious from capsules which,
when ripe, split asunder, at which time each portion is
a separate pod. It is also shown by different species
of one genus, in which modifications exist of the principle
on which their fruit is formed; for instance, the
capsule of <i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: nigilla">nigella</span> orientalis</i> consists of pods assembled
round a centre, and partially united; in <i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: nigilla">nigella</span> damascena</i>
their union is complete.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Professor Lindley thus explains the same view:&mdash;“Every
flower, with its peduncle and bracteolæ, being
the development of a flower-bud, and flower-buds being
altogether analogous to leaf-buds, it follows as a corollary
that every flower, with its peduncle and bracteolæ,
is a metamorphosed branch.</p>

<p>“And, further, the flowers being abortive branches,
whatever the laws are of the arrangement of branches
with respect to each other, the same will be the laws of
the flowers with respect to each other.</p>

<p>“In consequence of a flower and its peduncle being
a branch in a particular state, the rudimentary or metamorphosed
leaves which constitute bracteæ, floral envelopes,
and sexes, are subject to exactly the same laws
of arrangement as regularly-formed leaves.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The idea that the leaf is the principal organ of the
plant, and that from it all the other organs are probably
developed, is worthy the genius of the great German
poet.</p>

<p>Every leaf, a mystery in itself, is an individual gifted
with peculiar powers; they congregate in families, and
each one ministers to the formation of the branch on</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a>[Pg 371]</span></p>

<p>which it hangs, and to the main trunk of the tree of
which it is a member. The tree represents a world,
every part exhibiting a mutual dependence.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The one red leaf, the last of its clan,</div>
<div class="verse">That dances as often as dance it can;</div>
<div class="verse">Hanging so light and hanging so high,</div>
<div class="verse">On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>is influenced by, and influences, the lowest root which
pierces the humid soil. Like whispering voices, the
trembling leaves sing rejoicingly in the breeze and
summer sunshine, and they tremble alike with agony
when the equinoctial gale rends them from the parent
stalk. The influences which pervade the whole, making
up the sum of vital force, are disturbed by every movement
throughout the system; a wound on a leaf is
known to disturb the whole, and an injury inflicted on
the trunk interferes with the processes which are the
functions of every individual leaf.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The consideration of the physical circumstances
necessary to germination and vegetable growth, brings
us acquainted with many remarkable facts. At a temperature
below the freezing point, seeds will not germinate;
at the boiling point of water, a chemical change
is produced in the grain, and its power of germinating
is destroyed. Heat, therefore, is necessary to the development
of the embryo, but its power must only be
exerted within certain prescribed limits: these limits
are only constant for the same class of seeds, they vary
with almost every plant. This is apparent to every one,
in the different periods required for germination by the
seeds of dissimilar vegetables.</p>

<p>The seed is placed in the soil; shade is always&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>[Pg 372]</span>absolute
darkness sometimes&mdash;necessary for the success
of the germinating process. We have seen that the
first operation of nature is purely a chemical one, but
this manifestation of affinity is due to an exertion of
force, which is directly dependent upon solar power. The
seed is buried in the soil, when the genial showers of
spring, and the increasing temperature of the earth,
furnish the required conditions for this chemistry of
life, and the plant eventually springs into sunshine.
Thus we obtain evidence that even through some depth
of soil the solar power, whatever it may be, is efficient,
and that under its excitement the first spring of life,
in the germ, is effected.</p>

<p>The cotyledons and the plumule being formed, the
plant undergoes a remarkable change. The seed, like
an animal, absorbed oxygen and exhaled carbonic acid;
the first leaves secrete carbon from carbonic acid inspired,
and send forth, as useless to the plant, an excess
of oxygen gas.</p>

<p>This power of decomposing carbonic acid is a vital
function which belongs to the leaves and bark. It
has been stated, on the authority of Liebig, that during
the night the plant acts only as a mere bundle of fibres,&mdash;that
it allows of the circulation of carbonic acid and
its evaporation, unchanged. In his eagerness to support
his chemical hypothesis of respiration, the able chemist
neglected to inquire if this was absolutely correct. The
healthy plant never ceases to decompose carbonic acid
during one moment of its existence; but during the
night, when the excitement of light is removed, and the
plant reposes, its vital powers are at their minimum of
action, and a much less quantity is decomposed than
when a stimulating sun, by the action of its rays, is
compelling the exertion of every vital function.</p>

<p>During this process, we have another example of
natural organic chemistry. The four inorganic elements
of which the vegetable kingdom is composed&mdash;oxygen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a>[Pg 373]</span>
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon&mdash;are absorbed as air or
moisture by the leaves and through the roots, and the
great phenomenon of vegetable life is the conversion of
these to an organic condition. Sugar and gum are
constantly produced, and from these, by combination
with atmospheric nitrogen, a proteine compound is
formed, which is an essential element in the progress of
development.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Plants growing in the light are beautifully green, the
intensity of colouring increasing with the brilliancy of
the light. Those which are grown in the dark are etiolated,
their tissues are weak and succulent, their leaves
of a pale yellow. It is, therefore, evident that the formation
of this chlorophylle&mdash;as the green colouring
matter of leaves is called&mdash;results from some action
determined by the sun’s rays.</p>

<p>Chlorophylle is a carbonaceous compound formed in
the leaves, serving, it would appear, many purposes in
the process of assimilation. In the dark the plant still
requires carbon for its further development, and growing
slowly, it removes it from the leaves, decomposing the
chlorophylle, and supports its weak existence by preying
on parts of its own structure, until at length, this being
exhausted, it actually perishes of starvation.</p>

<p>Plants always turn towards the light: the guiding power
we know not, but the evidence of some impulsive or attracting
force is strong; and the purpose for which they
are constituted to obey it, is proved to be the dependence
of vegetable existence upon luminous power.</p>

<p>Light is not, however, alone sufficient to perfect the
plant: another agent is required to aid in the production
of flowers and fruits, and this power is proved to be
heat&mdash;and heat, perhaps, in some peculiar condition.
Having reached that point of development when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>[Pg 374]</span>
reproductive functions are, by another change in the
chemical operations going on within the vegetable
structure, to be called forth, it has been found that the
heat rays become in a remarkable manner effective. It
has also been observed that plants bend from the red,
or calorific rays, instead of towards them, as they are
found to do to every other ray of the spectrum. From
this we may argue that the influence of these rays is to
check the vegetation, and thus to ensure the perfection
of the reproductive processes.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that we have the means of
separating, to a considerable extent, the three principles
which we discover in the sunbeam, from each other, by
the use of absorbent media.</p>

<p>By a peculiar yellow glass we cut off the chemical
principle of the sunbeam, and admit the passage of the
<i>luminous rays</i> only&mdash;<span class="smcap">Light</span>.</p>

<p>By a cobalt blue glass we obstruct the <i>light</i>, but
allow the chemical agent to pass through freely, without,
indeed, any loss&mdash;<span class="smcap">Actinism</span>.</p>

<p>By a glass coloured deep blood-red by oxide of gold
we obstruct the chemical principle and much of the
light, but such a medium is perfectly transparent to
<span class="smcap">Heat</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore, this gives us the means of experimenting
with either of these principles, and of examining the
parts which they respectively play in the work of
organization.</p>

<p>Some seeds being placed in the soil, in every respect
in their natural conditions, duly supplied with moisture,
and a uniform and proper temperature maintained, we
place above the soil the three media above named, and
allow one portion to be exposed to all the ordinary
influences of the solar rays.</p>

<p>The result will be, that the seeds under the blue glass
will germinate long before those which are exposed to
the combined influences of the sunshine: a few of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a>[Pg 375]</span>
seeds will struggle into day under the red glass, but the
process of germination is entirely checked under the
yellow glass. Here we see that the chemical radiations
have quickened the chemical changes, and accelerated
the process, under the red glass, through which rays
having some peculiar chemical action pass; the germinating
process, though checked, is not entirely stopped.
Whereas, it would appear that under the influences of
light which has been deprived of chemical power, this
conversion of the starch into gum and sugar, which
appears to be necessary, is entirely prevented.</p>

<p>If the experiment is continued, it will be found that
under the blue glass the plants grow rapidly, but weakly;
and that instead of producing leaves and wood they
consist chiefly of stalk, upon which will be seen here
and there some abortive attempts to form leaves.
When the process of germination has terminated, if the
young plant is brought under the yellow glass, it grows
most healthfully, and forms an abundance of wood, the
leaves having an unusually dark green colour, from the
formation of a large quantity of chlorophylle. Plants
do not, however, produce flowers with readiness under
this medium; but if, at the proper period, they are
brought under the red glass, the flowering and fruiting
processes are most effectively completed.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a>[Pg 376]</span></p>
<p>These experiments, simple as they are, prove to us
the importance of light: the <i>luminous principle</i> of the
sunbeam is exciting the vital powers of the plant to
decompose carbonic acid and form wood; and the
calorific agent, possibly under those modifications which
have already been noticed as belonging to the parathermic
rays, is essential to the production of flower and
fruit.</p>

<p>Observations, which have been extended over many
years, prove that with the seasons these solar powers are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a>[Pg 377]</span>
relatively to each other, subject to an interesting change.
In the spring, the actinic or chemical power prevails,
and during this period its agency is required for the
vitalization of the germ. As the summer comes on,
the actinic rays diminish, and those of light increase.
Perhaps it would be more strictly correct to say that
the luminous intensity being increased, the chemical
power was retarded; the former expression implies a
variation in quantity, which may not be correct. We
see the necessity for this, since luminous power is required
for the secretion of the carbon, with which the
woody fibre is formed, and also for the elaboration of
the proximate principles of the plant. Autumn, the
season of fruit, is characterized by an increase of the
heat rays, and a diminution of the others: this change
being necessary, as science now teaches us, for the due
production of flower and fruit.</p>

<p>The calorific rays of the solar beam, to which the
autumnal phenomena of vegetation appear particularly
to belong, are of a peculiar character. They have been
called, the Parathermic rays, and exhibit a curious
compound nature. To these rays we may refer the
ripening of fruit and grain, and the browning of the leaf
before its fall. May not the rise of the sap in spring
be traced to the excitement of either light or actinism,
and its recession, in the autumn, to that power from
which the plant is found to bend, and which appears to
be their modified form of heat?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the varieties of climate
and the peculiarities of countries, as it regards their
animal and vegetable productions, are dependent on the
same causes. The distribution of species has been
referred by some to specific centres of creation around
which the plants and animals have spread, without
reference to physical conditions. Although centres of
creation may be admitted, these centres themselves
have been determined by the physical fitness of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>[Pg 378]</span>
centre to the conditions of the creation, and in like manner
the migration of tribes is solely due to these
physical forces we have been considering. In every
zone we find that vegetable organization is peculiarly
fitted for the considerations by which it is surrounded.
Under the equator we have the spice-bearing trees, the
nutmeg, the clove, the cinnamon, and the pepper-tree;
there we have also the odoriferous sandal, the ebony,
the banyan, and the teak: we have frankincense, and
myrrh, and other incense-bearing plants; the coffee-tree,
the tea-plant, and the tamarind.</p>

<p>A little further north we have the apricot, the citron,
the peach, and the walnut. In Spain, Sicily, and Italy,
we have the orange and lemon-tree blooming rich with
perfume, and the pomegranate and the myrtle growing
wild upon the rocks. Beyond the Alps the vegetation
again changes; instead of the cypress, the chesnut, and
the cork-tree, which prevail to the south of them, we
have the hardier oak, the beech, and the elm. Still further
north, we have the Scotch and spruce fir and larch.
On the northern shores of the Baltic, and in that line of
latitude, the hazel alone appears; and beyond this the
hoary alder, the sycamore, and the mountain ash.
Within the Arctic circle we find the mezereum, the
water-lilies, and the globe-flowers; and, when the
weakness of the solar radiations becomes too great even
for these, the reindeer moss still lends an aspect of
gladness to the otherwise sterile soil.</p>

<p>The cultivation of vegetables depends on the temperature
of the clime. The vine flourishes where the
mean annual temperature ranges between 50° and 73°,
and it is only cultivated profitably within 30° S. and 50°
N. of the equator. To the same limits is confined
the cultivation of maize and of olives. Cotton is grown
profitably up to latitude 46° in the Old World, but only
up to 40° in the New. We have evidence derived from
photographic phenomena, that the constitution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a>[Pg 379]</span>
solar rays varies with the latitude. The effects of the
sun’s rays in France and England in producing chemical
change are infinitely more decided than, with far greater
splendour of light, they are found to be in the lands
under or near the equator. Indeed, the remarks made
on the variations in the character of the sunbeam with
the changing seasons, may apply equally to the variations
in latitude.</p>

<p>Fungals are among the lowest forms of vegetation, but
in these we have peculiarities which appear to link them
with the animal kingdom. Marcet found that mushrooms
absorbed oxygen, and disengaged carbonic acid.
In all probability this is only a chemical phenomenon
of a precisely similar character to that which we know
takes place with decaying wood. In the conversion of
wood into <i>humus</i>, oxygen is absorbed, and combining with
the carbon, it is evolved as carbonic acid. Of course we
have the peculiar condition of vitality to modify the
effect, and we have, too, in this class of plants, the existence
of a larger quantity of nitrogen than is found in
any other vegetating substance.</p>

<p>These few sketches of remarkable phenomena connected
with vegetation are intended to show merely the
operations of the physical powers of the universe, so far
as we know them, upon these particular forms of
organization. During the process of germination,
electricity is, according to Pouillet, evolved; and again,
in ripening fruits, there appears to be some evidence of
electrical currents. Vegetables are, however, in the
growing state, such good conductors of electricity, that
it is not, according to the laws of this force, possible
that they should accumulate it; so that the luminous
phenomena stated to have been observed cannot be due
to this agency. We know, however, that under every
condition of change, whether induced by chemical or
calorific action, electricity is set in motion; and we
have reasons for believing that the excitation of light
will also give rise to electrical circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a>[Pg 380]</span></p>

<p>The question, whether plants possess sensation,
whether they have any disposition of parts at all
analogous to the nervous system of animals, has been
often put forward, but as yet the answers have been
unsatisfactory. The point is one well worthy all the
attention of the vegetable physiologist; but regarding
plants as the link between the animal and the mineral
kingdom,&mdash;looking upon phyto-chemistry, as exhibited
by them, as the means employed to produce those more
complex organizations which exist in animals,&mdash;we
necessarily consider plants as mere natural machines
for effecting organic arrangements, and, as such, that
they cannot possess any nervous sensibility. Muscular
contraction may be represented in many of their marvellous
arrangements; and any disturbance produced by
natural or artificial means would consequently effect a
change in the operations of those forces which combine
to produce vegetable life. Indeed, the experiments of
Carlo Matteucci, already referred to, prove that an
incision across a leaf, the fracture of a branch, or the
mere bruising of any part of the plant, interferes with
the exercise of that power which, under the operation of
luminous agency, decomposes carbonic acid, and effects
the assimilation of the other elements.</p>

<p>To recapitulate. A plant is an organized creation; it is
so in virtue of certain strange phyto-chemical operations,
which are rendered active by the solar influences
involved in the great phenomena of light, and by the
excitation of caloric force mid electrical circulation. It
is a striking exemplification of the united action of
certain empyreal powers, which give rise to the combination,
of inorganic principles under such forms that
they become capable of obeying the mysterious impulses
of life.</p>

<p>The poet has imaged the agency of external powers in
various shapes of spiritualized beauty. From the goddess
Flora, and her attendant nymphs, to the romantic
enchantress who called up flowers by the light touch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a>[Pg 381]</span>
her wand, we have, in all these creations, foreshadowings
of the discovery of those powers which science has shown
are essential to vegetable life. A power from without
influences the plant; but the animal is dependent upon
a higher agency which is potent within him.</p>

<p>The poet’s dream pleases the imaginative mind; and,
associating in our ideas all that is graceful and loveable
in the female form, with that diviner feeling which
impresses the soul with the sense of some unseen
spirituality, we perceive in the goddess, the enchantress,
or the sylph, pure idealizations of the physical powers.
The spirit floating over these forms of beauty, and
adorning them with all the richness of colour&mdash;painting
the rose, and giving perfume to the violet&mdash;is, in the
poet’s mind, one which ascends to nearly the highest
point of etherealization, and which becomes, indeed, to
him a spirit of light; they ride upon the zephyrs, and
they float, in all the luxury of an empyreal enjoyment,
down to the earth upon a sunbeam. Such is the work
of the imagination. What is the result of the search of
plodding science after truth? The sunbeam has been
torn into rays, and every ray tasked to tell of its
ministry.</p>

<p>Nature has answered to some of the interrogations;
and, passing over all the earth, echoed from plant to
plant, we have one universal cry proclaiming that every
function of vegetable life is due to the spirits of the
sun.</p>

<p>The mighty Adansonia of Senegal, hoary with the
mosses of five thousand years,&mdash;the Pohon upas in their
deadly valleys,&mdash;the climbing lianas of the Guiana
forests,&mdash;the contorted serpent-cactus on the burning
hills,&mdash;the oaks, which spread their branches in our
tempered climes,&mdash;the glorious flowers of the inter-tropical
regions, and those which gem our virent plains,&mdash;the
reindeer lichen of northern lands, and the confervæ
of the silent pool,&mdash;the greatest and humblest creations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>[Pg 382]</span>
of the vegetable world,&mdash;all proclaim their direct
dependence upon the mysterious forces which are bound
together in the silver thread of Light.</p>

<p>These undulations, pulsations too refined for mortal
ears, which quicken and guide these wonderful organisms,
may be indeed regarded as sphered music for ever
repeating the Divine command, “<i>Let there be Light</i>,”
by the creation of which, a dark and dreary chaos was
moulded into a star of beauty, capable of radiating brightness
to other space-wandering worlds.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am favoured with yours of the 5th, relative
to my practical experience in the effect of the chemical agency of
coloured media on the germination of seeds and the growth of
plants.
</p>
<p>
I must first explain that it is our practice to test the germinating
powers of all seeds which come into our warehouses before
we send them out for sale; and, of course, it is an object to discover,
with as little delay as possible, the extent that the vital
principle is active, as the value comes to be depreciated in the
ratio it is found to be dormant. For instance, if we sow 100
seeds of any sort, and the whole germinate, the seed will be the
highest current value; but if only 90 germinate, its value is 10
per cent. less; if 80, then its value falls 20 per cent.
</p>
<p>
I merely give this detail to show the practical value of this
test, and the influence it exerts on the fluctuation of prices.
</p>
<p>
Our usual plan formerly was to sow the seeds to be tested in a
hot-bed or frame, and then watch the progress and note the results.
It was usually from eight to fourteen days before we were in a
condition to decide on the commercial value of the seed under
trial.
</p>
<p>
My attention was, however, directed to your excellent work,
“On the Physical Phenomena of Nature,” about five years ago,
and I resolved to put your theory to a practical test. I accordingly
had a case made, the sides of which were formed of glass coloured
blue or indigo, which case I attached to a small gas stove for
engendering heat; in the case shelves were fixed in the inside, on
which were placed small pots wherein the seeds to be tested were
sown.
</p>
<p>
The results were all that could be looked for: the seeds freely
germinated in from two to five days only, instead of from eight to
fourteen days as before.
</p>
<p>
I have not carried our experiments beyond the germination of
seeds, so that I cannot afford practical information as to the effect
of other rays on the after culture of plants.
</p>
<p>
I have, however, made some trials with the yellow ray in preventing
the germination of seeds, which have been successful;
and I have always found the violet ray prejudicial to the growth
of the plant after germination.&mdash;I remain, my dear Sir,
</p>

<p class="p2">“A stone grows; plants grow and live; animals grow,
live, and feel.” Such were the distinctions made by
Linnæus, between the conditions of the three kingdoms
of nature. We cannot, however, but regard them as
in all respects illogical. The stone&mdash;a solid mass of
unorganized particles&mdash;enlarges, if placed in suitable
conditions, by the accretion of other similar particles
around it; but it does not, according to any meaning
in which we use the word, <i>grow</i>. Plants and animals
grow; and they differ, probably, only in the phenomena
of sensation. Yet, the trembling mimosa, and several
other plants, appear to possess as much feeling as
sponges and some of the lower classes of animals. By
this definition, however, of the celebrated Swedish
naturalist, we have a popular and simple expression of a
great fact.</p>

<p>As we have only to examine the question of the
agency of the physical forces upon animal life, we must
necessarily confine our attention to the more striking
phenomena with which science has made us acquainted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a>[Pg 384]</span>
and, having briefly traced the apparent order in which
the advance of organization proceeded, we must direct
our few concluding remarks to the physico-physiological
influences, which we must confess to know but too
imperfectly.</p>

<p>We learn that, during the states of progress which
geology, looking into the arcana of time, has made us
acquainted with, a great variety of animal forms were
brought into existence. They lived their periods. The
conditions of the surface of the earth, the sea, or the
atmosphere, were altered; and, no longer fitted for the
enjoyments of the new life, these races passed away, and
others occupied their places, which, in turn, went
through all the stages of growth, maturity, and decay;
until at length, the earth being constituted for the
abode of the highest order of animals, they were called
into existence; and man, the intellectual monarch of
the world, was placed supreme amongst them all. Types
of nearly all those forms of life which are found in the
fossil state are now in existence; and if we examine the
geographical distribution of animals&mdash;the zones of
elevation over the surface of the earth, and the zones of
depth in the ocean,&mdash;we shall find, now existing, animal
creations strikingly analogous to the primitive forms
and conditions of the earth’s inhabitants. From the
depths of the ocean we may even now study&mdash;as that
most indefatigable naturalist, Professor Edward Forbes,
has done&mdash;the varying states of organization under the
circumstances of imperfect light and varying temperature.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The gradual advance of animal life in the ascending
strata has led to many speculations, ingenious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a>[Pg 385]</span>
refined, on the progressive development of animals.
That the changes of the inorganic world have impressed
new conditions on the organic structures of animals, to
meet the necessities of their being, must be admitted.
Comparative anatomy has demonstrated that such supposed
differences really existed between the creatures of
secondary formations&mdash;those of the tertiary and the
present periods. It has been imagined, but upon debatable
foundations, that the atmosphere, during the
secondary periods, was highly charged with carbonic
acid; and, consequently, that though beneficial to the
growth of plants, and peculiarly fitted for the conditions
required by those which the fossil flora makes us acquainted
with, it was not adapted to support any animals
above the slow-breathing, cold-blooded fishes and reptiles.
Under the action of the super-luxuriant vegetation of
these periods, this carbonic acid is supposed to have been
removed, an addition of oxygen furnished; and thus,
consequently, the earth gradually fitted for the abode of
warm-blooded and quick-breathing creatures. We do,
indeed, find a very marked line between the fossil
remains of the lias formations which enclose the
saurians, and the wealden, in which birds make their
appearance more numerously than in any previous formation.</p>

<p>Founded upon these facts, speculations have been put
forth on the gradual development of animals from the
lowest up to the highest orders. Between the polype
and man a continuous series has been imagined, every
link of the chain being traced into connection with the
one immediately succeeding it; and, through all the
divisions, zoophytes, fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and
mammalia are seen, according to this hypothesis, to be
derived by gradual advancement from the preceding
orders. The first having given rise to amphibia,&mdash;the
amphibion gives birth to the reptile,&mdash;the reptile advances
to the bird,&mdash;and from this class is developed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a>[Pg 386]</span>
mammal. A slight investigation will convince us that
this view has no foundation. Although a certain relationship
may be found between some of the members
of one class, and those of the other immediately joining
it, yet this is equally discovered to exist towards
classes more remote from each other; and in no one
instance can we detect anything like the passage of an
animal of one class into an animal of another. Until
this is done, we cannot but regard the forms of animal
life as distinct creations, each one fitted for its state of
being, springing from the command of the great First
Cause.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>But it is time to quit these speculative questions, and
proceed to the examination of the general conditions of
animal life at the present time.</p>

<p>Lowest in the scale of animals, and scarcely distinguishable
from a vegetable, we find the sponge, attached
to and passing its life upon a rock, exhibiting, indeed,
less signs of feeling than many of the vegetable tribes.
The chemical differences between vegetables and sponges
are, however, very decided; and we find in the tissues
of the sponge a large quantity of nitrogen, a true animal
element, which exists, but in smaller quantities, in
vegetables.</p>

<p>These creations, standing between vegetable and
animal life, possess the singular power of decomposing
carbonic acid, as plants do; and the water in which they
live always contains an excess of free oxygen.</p>

<p>The polypes are a remarkably curious class. “Fixed
in large arborescent masses to the rocks of tropical seas,
or in our own climate attached to shells or other submarine
substances, they throw but their ramifications in
a thousand beautiful and plant-like forms; or, incrusting
the rocks at the bottom of the ocean with calcareous
earth, separated from the water which bathes them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>[Pg 387]</span>
silently build up reefs and shoals, justly dreaded by the
navigator; and sometimes giving origin, as they rise
to the surface of the sea, to islands, which the lapse of
ages clothes with luxuriant verdure, and peoples with
appropriate inhabitants.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Most of the polypes are fixed and stationary; but the
hydra and some others have the power of changing their
positions, which they do in search of the light of the
sun. They do not appear to have organs of sight requiring
light; but still they delight in the solar influences.
The most extraordinary fact connected with the hydra
is its being multiplied by division. If an incision be
made in the side of a hydra, a young polype soon developes
itself; and if one of these creatures be divided,
it quickly restores the lost portion of its structure. The
varieties of the polypes are exceedingly numerous, and
many of them are in the highest degree curious, and
often very beautiful. The actiniæ, like flowers, appear
to grow from the rocks, unfolding their tentacula to the
light; and, in the excitement due to their eagerness for
prey, they exhibit a beautiful play of colours and most
interesting forms. Microscopic zoophytes of the most
curious shapes are found,&mdash;all of which attest, under
examination, the perfection of all created things.</p>

<p>Infusoria and animalcula,&mdash;animals, many of them,
appearing under the microscope as little more than a
transparent jelly,&mdash;must be recognized as the most
simple of the forms of life. They exist in all waters
in uncountable myriads; and, minute creatures as
they are, it has been demonstrated that many of the
great limestone hills are composed entirely of their
remains.</p>

<p>The acalephæ, or the phosphorescent animals of the
ocean, are no less curious. From creatures of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a>[Pg 388]</span>
minute size, they extend to a considerable magnitude,
yet they appear to be little more than animated masses
of sea-water. If any one of these sea-jellies, or jelly-fishes
as they are often called (even the largest varieties
of them), is cast upon the shore, it is soon, by the influence
of the sun, converted into a mere fibre no thicker
than a cobweb: an animal weighing seven or eight
pounds is very soon reduced to as many grains. There
are numerous kinds of these singular creatures, most of
which are remarkable for the powerful phosphorescent
light they emit. The <i>beroes</i> and the <i>pulmonigrade</i> shine
with an intense white light many feet below the surface,
whilst the <i>Cestum Veneris</i>, or girdle of Venus, gliding
rapidly along, presents, on the edge of the wave, an undulating
riband of flame of considerable length. There
can be no doubt that this arises from the emission of
phosphorescent matter of an unknown kind from the
bodies of these animals.</p>

<p>The microscope has made us familiar with the mysteries
of a minute creation which we should not otherwise
have comprehended. These creatures are found
inhabiting the waters and the land, and they exist in
the intestinal structure of plants and animals, preying
upon the nutritive juices which pass through their
systems. Although these beings are so exceedingly
small that even the most practised observer cannot
detect them with the naked eye, they are proved, by
careful examination under the microscope, to be in many
cases elaborately organized. Ehrenberg has discovered
in them filamentary nerves and nervous masses, and
even vessels appropriated to the circulation of fluids,
showing that they belong really to a high condition of
existence.</p>

<p>Passing over many links in that curious chain which
appears to bind the animal kingdom into a complete
whole, we come to the articulata of Cuvier&mdash;the homogangliata
of Owen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a>[Pg 389]</span></p>

<p>All those creatures which we have been hitherto considering
are too imperfect in the construction of their
simple organizations to maintain a terrestrial existence;
they are, therefore, confined to a watery medium. In
the articulata, we have evidences of higher attributes,
and indications of instincts developed in proportion to
the increased perfection of organization. Commencing
with the annelidans, all of which, except the earthworms,
are inhabitants of the waters, we proceed to the
myriapoda, presenting a system intermediate in every
respect between that of worms and insects; we then
find embraced in the same order, the class insecta,
which includes flies and beetles of all kinds; and,
as the fourth division of articulated beings, the arachnidans
or spiders; and, lastly, the marine tribe of crustaceans.</p>

<p>The most remarkable phenomena connected with
these animals are the metamorphoses which they
undergo. The female butterfly, for instance, lays eggs,
which, when hatched, produce caterpillars: these live
in this state for some time, feeding upon vegetables,
and, after casting their skins as they increase in size,
at last assume an entirely different state, and, dormant
in their oblong case, they appear like dead matter.
This chrysalis, or pupa, is generally preserved from
injury by being embedded in the earth, from which,
after a season, a beautifully perfect insect escapes, and,
floating on the breeze of summer, enjoys its sunshine,
and revels amidst its flowers.</p>

<p>No less remarkable is the metamorphosis of the caducibranchiate
amphibia, passing through the true fish
condition of the tadpole to the perfect air-breathing
and four-footed animal, the frog.</p>

<p>A metamorphosis of the crustaceans, somewhat similar
to that which takes place in insects, has been of late
years creating much discussion amongst naturalists:
but the question appears to be now settled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>[Pg 390]</span>
careful and long-continued observations of Mr. Thompson
and Mr. R. C. Couch.</p>

<p>A wide line of demarcation marks the separation of
the invertebrata from the four great classes of vertebrate
animals&mdash;fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammalia. Every
part of the globe,&mdash;the ocean and the inland lake,&mdash;the
wide and far-winding river, and the babbling stream,&mdash;the
mountain and the valley,&mdash;the forest with its depth
of shade, and the desert with its intensity of light,&mdash;the
cold regions of the frost-chained north, and the
fervid clime within the tropics&mdash;presents for our study
innumerable animals, each fitted for the conditions to
which it is destined; and through the whole we find a
gradual elevation in the scale of intelligence, until at
last, separated from all by peculiar powers, we arrive at
man himself.</p>

<p>In each of these four classes the animals are furnished
with a bony skeleton, which is in the young
animal little more than cartilage; but, as growth increases,
lime becomes deposited, and a sufficient degree
of hardness is thus produced to support the adult formation.
Some anatomists have endeavoured to show
that even in the mechanical structure of the bony fabrics
of animals, we are enabled to trace a gradual increase
in the perfection of arrangement, from the fish until the
most perfect is found in man. Many of the mammalia,
however, are furnished with skeletons which really
surpass that of man. These belong to animals which
depend for subsistence upon their muscular powers, and
with whom man is, in this particular, on no equality.
What is the lord of the creation, compared with the
antelope for fleetness, or with the elephant and many
other animals for strength?</p>

<p>As we ascend the scale of animal life we find a more
perfectly developed nervous system; and the relative
size of the brain, compared with that of the brute, is
found progressively to increase, until it arrives at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a>[Pg 391]</span>
utmost perfection in man. On the system of nerves
depends sensation, and there can be no doubt that the
more exalted the order of intelligence displayed, the
more exquisitely delicate is the nervous system. Thus,
in this world, refined genius must necessarily be attended
with a condition of sensibility which, too frequently,
to the possessor is a state of real disease.</p>

<p>It must be evident to every reader that but very few
of the striking features of animal life have been mentioned
in the rapid survey which has been taken of the
progress of animal organization. The subject is so
extensive that it would be quite impossible to embrace
it within any reasonable limits; and it furnishes
matter so curious and so instructive, that, having once
entered on it, it would have been difficult to have made
any selection, and we must have devoted a volume to
the æsthetics of natural science. Passing it by, therefore,
with the mere outline which has been given, we
must proceed to consider some of the conditions of
vitality.</p>

<p>Bell has proved that one set of nerves is employed in
conveying sensation to the brain, and another set in
transferring the desires of the will to the muscles. By
the separation of a main branch of one of the nerves
of sensation, although all the operations of life will still
proceed, the organ to which that nerve goes is dead to
its particular sense. In like manner, if one of the
nerves of volition is divided, the member will not obey
the inclination of the brain. It is evident, therefore,
although many of the great phenomena of vital force
are dependent on the nervous system, and the paralysis
of a member ensues upon the separation or the disease
of a nerve, that the nerves are but the channels through
which certain influences are carried. The <i>vis vitæ</i> or
vital principle&mdash;for we are compelled by the imperfection
of our knowledge to associate under this one term the
ultimate causes of many of the phenomena of life&mdash;is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a>[Pg 392]</span>
power which, although constantly employed, has the
capability of continually renewing itself by some inexplicable
connection existing between it and many
external influences. We know that certain conditions
are necessary to the health of animals. Diseased digestion,
or any interruption in the circulation of the blood,
destroys the vital force, and death ensues. The processes
of digestion and of the circulation are perfectly
understood, yet we are no nearer the great secret of the
living principle.</p>

<p>Animals are dependent on several external agents for
the support of existence. The oxygen of the air is
necessary for respiration. Animal heat, as will be
shown presently, is in a great measure dependent upon
it. The external heat is so regulated that animal
existence is comfortably supported. Electricity is
without doubt an essential element in the living processes;
and, indeed, many physiologists have been
inclined to refer vital force to the development of electricity
by chemical action in the brain. This view has,
however, no foundation in experiment beyond that
afforded by the appearance of electric currents, when
the brain is excited. This proves no more than that
the operations of mind develope physical power in the
matter with which it is mysteriously connected.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the Torpedo and Gymnotus we
have already noticed,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and there are other creatures
which certainly possess the power of secreting and discharging
electricity. Galvani’s experiments, and those
of Aldini, appear to show&mdash;and the more delicate
researches of Matteucci have satisfactorily determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a>[Pg 393]</span>&mdash;that
currents of electricity are always circulating in
the animal frame;&mdash;that positive electricity is constantly
passing from the interior to the exterior of a muscle.
Matteucci, by arranging a series of muscles, has formed
an electric pile of some energy.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> These currents
have been detected in man, in pigeons, fowls, eels, and
frogs.</p>

<p>In the human body it is evident a large quantity of
electricity exists in a state of equilibrium. Du Bois
Raymond has shown that we may by mere muscular
motion give rise to electric currents which can be
measured by the galvanometer. This, however, may be
said of every substance. It is perhaps more easily disturbed
in the human system; indeed, the manifestation
of sparks from the hair and other parts of the body by
friction is not uncommon. Every chemical action, it
has been already shown, gives rise to electrical manifestations;
and the animal body is a laboratory, beautifully
fitted with apparatus, in which nearly every
chemical process is going on. It has been proved that
acid and alkaline principles are constantly acting upon
each other through the tissues of the animal frame;
and we have the curious phenomena of endosmose and
exosmose in constant effort, and catalysis or <i>surface force</i>,
operating in a mysterious manner.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>With the refined physiological questions connected
with the phenomena of sensation we cannot deal, nor
will any argument be adduced for or against the hy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a>[Pg 394]</span>pothesis
which would refer these phenomena to some
extraordinary development of electric force in the brain.
The entire subject appears to stand beyond the true
limits of science, and every attempt to pass it is invariably
found to lead to a confused mysticism, in which
the real and the ideal are strangely confounded. Science
stops short of the phenomena of vital action.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, but refer to the idea entertained
by many that the brain is an electric battery, and the
nerves a system of conductors. On this view Sir John
Herschel remarks:&mdash;“If the brain be an electric pile
constantly in action, it may be conceived to discharge
itself at regular intervals, when the tension of the electricity
reaches a certain point, along the nerves which
communicate with the heart, and thus excite the pulsation
of that organ.” Priestley, however, appears to
have been the first to promulgate this idea.</p>

<p>Light is an essential element in producing the grand
phenomenon of life, though its action is ill understood.
Where there is light, there is life, and any deprivation
of this principle is rapidly followed by disease of the
animal frame, and the destruction of the mental faculties.
We have proof of this in the squalor of those whose necessities
compel them to labour in places to which the
blessings of sunshine never penetrate, as in our coal-mines,
where men having everything necessary for health,
except light, exhibit a singularly unhealthy appearance.
The state of fatuity and wretchedness to which those
individuals have been reduced who have been subjected
for years to incarceration in dark dungeons, may be referred
to the same deprivation. Again, in the peculiar
aspect of those people who inhabit different regions of
the earth under varying influences of light, we see evidence
of the powerful effects of solar action. Other
forces, as yet undiscovered, may, in all probability do,
exert decided influences on the animal economy; but,
although we recognize many effects which we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a>[Pg 395]</span>
refer to any known causes, we are perfectly unable to
imagine the sources from which they spring.</p>

<p>It will be interesting now to examine the phenomena
of animal heat, the consideration of which naturally leads
us to consider the digestive system, the circulatory processes,
and the effects of nervous excitation.</p>

<p>The theory, which attributes animal heat to the
combination of the carbon of the food taken into the
stomach with the oxygen of the air inspired through
the lungs, has become a very favourite one. It must,
however, be remembered that it is by no means new.
The doctrines of Brown, known as the Brunonian
system, and set forth in his <i>Elementa Medicinæ</i>, are
founded upon similar hasty generalizations. Although,
without doubt, true in a certain degree, it is not so to
the extent to which its advocates would have us believe.
That the carbonaceous matter received into the stomach,
after having undergone the process of digestion, enters
into combination with the oxygen breathed through the
lungs or absorbed by the skin, and is given off from
the body in the form of carbonic acid, and that, during the
combination, heat is produced, by a process similar to
that of ordinary combustion, is an established fact; but
the idea of referring animal heat entirely to this chemical
source, when there are other well-known causes producing
calorific effects, is an example of the errors into
which an ingenious mind may be led, when eagerly
seeking to establish a favourite hypothesis.</p>

<p>Animal and vegetable diet, which is composed largely
of carbon and hydrogen, passes into the digestive
system, and becomes converted into the various matters
required for the support of the animal structure. The
blood is the principal fluid employed in distributing over
the system the necessary elements of health and vigour,
and for restoring the waste of the body. This fluid, in
passing through the lungs, undergoes a very remarkable
change, and not merely assumes a different colour, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>[Pg 396]</span>
really acquires new properties, from its exposure to the
air with which the cells of these organs are filled. By
a true chemical process, the oxygen is separated from
the air, that oxygen is made to combine with the carbon
and hydrogen, and carbonic acid and water are formed.
These are liberated and thrown off from the body either
through the lungs or by the skin. In the processes of
life, as far as we are enabled to trace them, we see
actions going on which are referred to certain causes
which we <i>appear</i> to explain. Thus, the combination of
the oxygen of the air with the carbon of the blood is
truly designated a case of chemical affinity; and we
find that in endeavouring to imitate the processes of
nature in the laboratory, we are, to a certain extent,
successful. We can combine carbon and oxygen to
produce carbonic acid; and we know that the result of
that combination is the development of certain definite
quantities of heat. Let us examine the conditions of
this chemical phenomenon, and we shall find that in the
natural and artificial processes,&mdash;for we must be allowed
to make that distinction,&mdash;there are analogous circumstances.
If we place a piece of pure carbon, a lump of
charcoal or a diamond, in a vessel of air, or even of pure
oxygen gas, no change will take place in either of these
elements, and, however long they may be kept together,
they will still be found as carbon or diamond, and
oxygen gas. If we apply heat to the carbon until it
becomes incandescent, it immediately begins to combine
with the oxygen gas,&mdash;it burns;&mdash;after a little
time all the carbon has disappeared, and we shall find,
if the experiment has been properly made, that a gas is
left behind which is distinguished by properties in every
respect the reverse of those of oxygen, supporting neither
life nor combustion, whereas oxygen gives increased
vigour to both. We have now, indeed, carbonic acid
gas formed by the union of the two principles.</p>

<p>A dead mass of animal matter may be placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a>[Pg 397]</span>
oxygen gas, and, unless some peculiar conditions are in
some way brought about, no change will take place;
but, if it were possible to apply the <i>spark of life</i> to it,
as we light up the spark in the other case, or if, as that
is beyond the power of man, we substitute a living
creature, a combination between the carbon of the
animal and the gas will immediately begin, and carbonic
acid will be formed by the waste of animal matter, as
in the other case it is by the destruction of the carbon;
and, if there is not a fresh supply given, the animal
must die, from the exhaustion of its fabric. Now, in
both these cases, it is clear that, although this chemical
union is a proximate cause of heat, there must be
existing some power superior to it, as the ultimate cause
thereof.</p>

<p>The slow combustion (<i>eremacausis</i>) of vegetable
matter, decomposing under the influence of moisture
and the air, does not present similar conditions to those
of the human body, although it has been insisted upon
to be in every respect analogous. That the results
resemble each other is true, but we must carefully distinguish
between effects and causes; and the results of
chemical decomposition in inert matter differ from those
in the living organism. The vegetable matter has lost
the principle of organic life, and, that gone, the tendency
of all things being to be resolved into their most simple
forms, a disunion of the elements commences: oxygen,
hydrogen, and carbon pass off either in the gaseous
state or as water, whilst some carbon is liberated in a
very finely-divided condition, and enters slowly into
combination with oxygen supplied by the water or the
air. Hydrogenous compounds are at the same time
formed, and, under all these circumstances, as in all
other chemical phenomena, an alteration of temperature
results. Heat results from the chemical changes, and
eventually true combustion begins.</p>

<p>The animal tissue may act in the same way as platina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a>[Pg 398]</span>
has already been shown to act in producing combination
between gases; but of this we have no proof. We
know that electricity is capable of producing the
required conditions, and we also learn, from the beautiful
researches of Faraday, that the quantity of electricity
developed during decomposition is exactly equal
to that required to effect the combination of the same
elements. Thus it is quite clear that, during the combination
of the carbon of the blood with the oxygen of
the air, a large amount of electricity must become
latent in the compound. The source of this we know
not: it may be derived from some secret spring within
the living structure, or it may be gathered from the
matter surrounding it. There is much in nervous excitation
which appears like electrical phenomena, and
attempts have been frequently made to refer sensation
to the agency of electricity. But these are the dreams
of the ingenious, for which there is but little waking
reality.</p>

<p>Every mechanical movement of the body occasions
the development of heat; every exertion of the muscles
produces sensible warmth; and, indeed, it can be shown
by experiment that every expansion of muscular fibre is
attended with the escape of caloric, and its contraction
with the absorption of it. There are few operations of
the mind which do not excite the latent caloric of the
body, and frequently we find it manifested in a very remarkable
manner by a suddenly-awakened feeling. The
poet, in the pleasure of creation, glows with the ardour
of his mind, and the blush of the innocent is but the
exhibition of the phenomenon under some nervous excitation,
produced by a spirit-disturbing thought. Thus
we see that the processes of digestion and respiration
are not the only sources of animal heat, but that many
others exist to which much of the natural temperature
of the body must be referred.</p>

<p>So much that is mysterious belongs to the phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a>[Pg 399]</span>
of life, that superstition has had a wide scope for the
exercise of its influence; and through all ages a powerful
party of mankind have imagined that the spirit of
human curiosity must be checked before it advances to
remove the veil from any physiological causes. Hence
it is that even at the present day so much that stands
between what, in our ignorance, we call the real and the
supernatural, remains uninvestigated. Even those men
whose <span class="correction" title="In the original book: mind">minds</span> are sceptical upon any development of the
truths of great natural phenomena,&mdash;who, at all events,
will have proof before they admit the evidence, are
ready to give credit to the grossest absurdities which
may be palmed upon them by ingenious charlatans,
where the subject is man and his relations to the
spiritual world.</p>

<p>Man, and the races of animals by which he is surrounded,
present a very striking group, consider them
in whatever light we please. The gradual improvement
of organic form, and the consequent increase of sensibility,
and eventually the development of reason, are
the grandest feature of animated creation.</p>

<p>The conditions as to number even of the various
classes are not the least remarkable phenomena of life.
In the lowest orders of animals, creatures of imperfect
organization,&mdash;consequently those to whom the conditions
of pain must be nearly unknown,&mdash;increase by
countless myriads. Of the infusoria and other beings,
entire mountains have been formed, although microscopes
of the highest powers are required to detect an
individual. Higher in the scale, even among insects,
the same remarkable conditions of increase are observed.
Some silkworms lay from 1,000 to 2,000 eggs; the
wasp deposits 3,000; the ant from 4,000 to 5,000.
The queen bee lays between 5,000 and 6,000 eggs
according to Burmeister; but Kirby and Spence state
that in one season the number may amount to 40,000 or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a>[Pg 400]</span>
50,000. But, above all, the white ant (<i>Termes fatalis</i>)
produces 86,400 eggs each day, which, continuing for a
lunar month, gives the astonishing number of 2,419,200,
a number far exceeding that produced by any known
animal.</p>

<p>These may appear like the statements in which a
fictionist might indulge, but they are the sober truths
discovered by the most pains-taking and cautious
observers. And it is necessary that such conditions
should prevail. These insects, and all the lower tribes
of the animal kingdom, furnish food for the more
elevated races. Thousands are born in an hour, and
millions upon millions perish in a day. For the support
of organic life, like matter is required; and we
find that the creatures who are destined to become the
prey of others are so constituted that they pass from
life with a perfect unconsciousness of suffering. As the
animal creation advances in size and strength, their
increase becomes limited; and thus they are prevented
from maintaining by numbers that dominion over the
world which they would be enabled from their powers
to do, were their bands more numerous than we now
find them.</p>

<p>The comparative strength, too, of the insect tribes has
ever been a subject of wonder and of admiration to the
naturalist. The strength of these minute creatures is
enormous; their muscular power, in relation to their
size, far exceeds that of any other animal. The grasshopper
will spring two hundred times the length of its
own body. The dragonfly, by its strength of wing, will
sustain itself in the air for a long summer day with
unabated speed. The house-fly makes six hundred
strokes with its wings, which will carry it five feet,
every second. The stag-beetle, were it the size of the
elephant, would be able to tear up the largest mountains.</p>

<p>Such are the wonders of the natural world; from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a>[Pg 401]</span>
zoophyte, growing like a flowering plant<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> upon an
axis filled with living pith&mdash;a small remove from the
conditions of vegetable life, upwards through the myriads
of breathing things&mdash;to man, we see the dependence
of all upon these physical powers which we have been
considering.</p>

<p>To trace the effects of those great causes through all
their mysterious phases is the work of inductive science;
and the truths discovered tend to fit us for the enjoyment
of the eternal state of high intelligence to which
every human soul aspires.</p>

<p>That which the ignorant man calls the supernatural,
the philosopher classes amongst natural phenomena.
The ideal of the credulous man becomes the real to him
who will bend his mind to the task of inquiry. Therefore
to attempt to advance our knowledge of the unknown,
to add to the stores of truth, is an employment
worthy the high destiny of the human race. Remembering
that the revelations of natural science cannot in
any way injure the revelation of eternal truth, but, on
the contrary, aid to establish in the minds of the doubting
a firm conviction of its Divine origin and of man’s
high position, we need never fear that we are proceeding
too far with any inquiry, so long as we are cautious to
examine the conditions of our own minds, that they
be not made the dupe of the senses.</p>

<p>In the fairies of the hills and valleys, in the gnomes
of the caverns, in the spirits of the elements, we have
the attempts of the mind, when the world was young,
to give form to the dim outshadowings of something
which was then felt to be hidden behind external
nature.</p>

<p>In the Oread, the Dryad, and the Nereid, we have, in
like manner, an embodiment of powers which the poet-philosopher
saw in his visions presiding over the moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a>[Pg 402]</span>tain,
the forest, and the ocean. Content with these,
invested as they were with poetic beauty, man for ages
held them most religiously sacred; but the progress of
natural science has destroyed this class of creations.
“Great Pan is dead,” but the mountains are not voiceless;
they speak in a more convincing tone; and,
instead of the ear catching the dying echo of an obscure
truth, it is gladdened with the full, clear note of nature
in the sweetest voice proclaiming secrets which were
unknown to the dreams of superstition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="center">GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.</p>


<p class="chap-head">The Changes produced on Physical Phenomena by the Movement
of the Solar System considered&mdash;Exertion of the
Physical Forces through the Celestial Spaces&mdash;The Balance
of Powers&mdash;Varieties of Matter&mdash;Extension of Matter&mdash;Theory
of Nonentity&mdash;A Material Creation an indisputable
fact&mdash;Advantages of the Study of Science&mdash;Conclusion.</p>


<p class="p2">We have examined terrestrial phenomena under many
of the harmonious conditions which, with our limited
intelligence, we can reach by the aid of science. From
the first exhibition of force, in the cohesion of two
atoms, onward to the full development of organic form
in the highest order of animals, we have observed
strange influences. We have seen the solitary molecule
invested with peculiar properties, and regulated by
mighty forces; we have learned that the modes of
motion given to this beautiful sphere produce curious
changes in the operation of these powers; and we may
with safety infer that every atom constituting this globe
is held in wonderful suspension against every atom of
every star, in the celestial spaces, even to that bright
orb in the centre of the Pleiades, around which the
entire system of created worlds is supposed to roll.</p>

<p>As we move around our own sun&mdash;in the limited
period of 365 days, and round our own axis in 24 hours&mdash;we
experience transitions from heat to cold, dependent
upon our position in regard to that luminary and
the laws which regulate the reception and retention of
certain physical forces. May we not therefore conclude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a>[Pg 404]</span>
without being charged with making any violent deduction,
that in the great revolution of our system around
the centre of space, we are undergoing gradual changes
which are essential to the great scheme of creation,
though at present incomprehensible to us?</p>

<p>In our consideration of the influence of time on the
structure of the earth as we find it, we discovered that,
in ages long past, the vegetation of the tropics existed
upon these northern parts of the globe; and geological
research has also proved that over the same lands the
cold of an arctic winter must have long prevailed&mdash;the
immense glaciers of that period having left the marks of
their movements upon the face of the existing rocks.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
We know that during 3,000 years no change of temperature
has taken place in the European climate.
The children of Israel found the date and the vine
flourishing in Canaan; and they exist there still.
Arago has shown that a trifling alteration of temperature
would have destroyed one or the other of these
fruit-bearing trees, since the vine will not ripen where
the mean temperature of the year is higher than 84°, or
the date flourish where it sinks below that degree.</p>

<p>How immense, then, the duration of time since these
changes must have taken place! The 432,000 years of
Oriental mythology is a period scarcely commensurable
with these effects; yet, to the creature of three-score
years, that period appears an eternity. The thirty-three
millions of geographical miles which our solar system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a>[Pg 405]</span>
traverses annually, if multiplied by three thousand years,
during which we know no change has taken place, give
us 99,000,000,000 as the distance passed over in that
period. How wide, then, must have been the journey
of the system in space to produce the alteration in the
physical powers, by which these changes have been
effected!</p>

<p>We have an example, and a striking one, of the variations
which may be produced in all the physical conditions
of a world, in those disturbances of Uranus which
led to the discovery of Neptune. For thirty years or
more certain perturbations were observed in this distant
planet, the discovery of Sir William Herschel, and
calculation pointed to some still more remote mass of
matter as the cause, which has been verified by its actual
discovery. But now Uranus is at rest;&mdash;quietly that
star progresses in its appointed orbit,&mdash;Neptune can no
longer, for the present, cause it to move with greater or
less rapidity&mdash;they are too remote to produce any sensible
influence upon each other. Consequently, for thirty years,
it is evident, phenomena must have occurred on the surface
of Uranus, which can be no longer repeated until these
two planets again arrive at the same positions in their
respective paths which they have occupied since 1812.
These considerations assist us in our attempts to comprehend
infinite time and space; but the human mind
fails to advance far in the great sublimity.</p>

<p>Through every inch of space we have evidence of the
exercise of such forces as we have been considering.
Gravitation chains world to world, and holds them all
suspended from the mystic centre. Cohesion binds
every mass of matter into a sphere, while motion exerts
a constant power, which tends to alter the form of the
mass. The earth’s form&mdash;a flattened spheroid&mdash;the
rings of Saturn and of Neptune are the consequences
of motion in antagonism to cohesion. Heat, radiating
from one planet to another, does its work in all, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a>[Pg 406]</span>
variety to matter. Light seeks out every world&mdash;each
trembling star tells of the mystery of its presence.
Where light and heat are, chemical action, as an
associated power, must be present; and electricity
must do its wondrous duties amongst them all. Modified
by peculiar properties of matter, they may not
manifest themselves in phenomena like those of our
terrestrial nature; but the evidence of light is a sufficient
proof of the presence of its kindred elements; and it is
difficult to imagine all these powers in action without
producing some form of organization. In the rounded
pebble which we gather from the sea-shore, in the medusa
floating bright with all the beauty of prismatic
colour in the sun-lit sea,&mdash;in the animal, mighty in his
strength, roaming the labyrinthine forests, or, great in
intelligence, looking from this to the mysteries of other
worlds,&mdash;in all created things around us, we see direct
evidence of a <span class="correction" title="In the original book: beautifnl">beautiful</span> adjustment of the balance of
forces, and the harmonious arrangement of properties.</p>

<p>One atom is removed from a mass and its character
is changed; one force being rendered more active than
another, and the body, under its influence, ceases to be
the same in condition. The regulation which disposes
the arrangements of matter on this earth, must exist
through the celestial spaces, and every planet bears the
same relation to every other glittering mass in heaven’s
o’erarching canopy, as one atom bears to another in the
pebble, the medusa, the lion, or the man. An indissoluble
bond unites them all, and the grain of sand
which lies buried in the depth of one of our primary formations,
holds, chained to it by these all-pervading
forces, the uncounted worlds which, like luminous sand,
are sprinkled by the hand of the Creator through the
universe. Thus we advance to a conception of the oneness
of creation.</p>

<p>The vigorous mind of that immortal bard who sang
“of man’s first disobedience,” never, in the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a>[Pg 407]</span>
rapture, the holiest trance of poetic conception, dreamed
of any natural truths so sublime as those which science
has revealed to us.</p>

<p>The dependence of all the systems of worlds upon
each other, every dust composing each individual globe
being “weighed in a balance,” the adjustment of the
powers by which every physical condition is ordered, the
disposition of matter in the mass of the earth, and the
close relation of the kingdoms of nature,&mdash;are all revelations
of natural truths, exalting the mind to the divine
conception of the universe.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable antagonism displayed in the
operation of many of these forces. Gravitation and
cohesion act in opposition to the repellent influences of
caloric. Light and heat are often associated in a very
remarkable manner; but they are certainly in their
radiant states in antagonism to chemical action, whether
produced by the direct agency of actinic force, or through
the intermediate excitement of the electrical current.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
And in relation to chemical force, as manifested in organic
combinations, we have the all-powerful operation
of <span class="smcap">life</span> preventing any exercise of its decomposing
power.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> As world is balanced against world in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a>[Pg 408]</span>
universe, so in the human fabric, in the vegetable structure,
in the crystallized gem, or in the rude rock, force
is weighed against force, and the balance hangs in tranquillity.
Let but a slight disturbance <span class="correction" title="In the original book: occcasion">occasion</span> a vibration
of the beam, and electricity shakes the stoutest
heart with terror, at the might of its devastating power.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Heat melts the hardest rocks, and the earth trembles
with volcanic strugglings; and actinic agency, being
freed from its chains, speedily spreads decay over the
beautiful, and renders the lovely repulsive.</p>

<p>We know matter in an infinite variety of forms, from
the most ponderous metal to the lightest gas; and we
have it within our power to render the most solid bodies
invisible in the condition of vapour. Is it not easy, then,
to understand that matter may exist equally attenuated
in relation to hydrogen, as that gas itself is, when compared
with the metal platinum? A doubt has been
raised against this view, from the difficulty of accounting
for the passage of the physical elements through solid
masses of matter. If we, however, remember that the
known gases have the power of transpiration through
matter in a remarkable degree,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and that the passage of
water through a sieve may be prevented by heat, it will
be at once apparent that the permeation of any radiant
body through fixed solid matter is entirely a question
of conditions.</p>

<p>We can form no idea of the size of the ultimate atom;
we cannot comprehend the degree of etherealization to
which matter may be extended. Our atmosphere,
we have seen, is only another condition of the same
elements which compose all the organized forms of
matter upon the earth, and, at the height reached by
man, it is in a state of extreme attenuation. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a>[Pg 409]</span>
must be its condition at the distance of forty miles from
the earth? According to known laws, certain phenomena
of refraction have led us to set these bounds to
the matter constituting our globe: but it may exist in
such a state of tenuity, that no philosophical instrument
constructed by human hands could measure its refracting
power; and who shall declare with certainty that matter
itself may not be as far extended as we suppose its
influences to be?</p>

<p>“Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare
if thou knowest it all.</p>

<p>“Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? Canst
thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?”</p>

<p>A cheerless philosophy, derived from the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: transendentalism">transcendentalism</span>
of the German schools, by an unhappy metaphysical
subtlety, and grafted upon what professes to be a
positive philosophy, but which is not so, is spreading
amongst us, and would teach us to regard all things
as the mere exhibition of properties, a manifestation
of powers; it believes not in a material creation.
The grandeur of the earth, and the beautiful forms
adorning it, are not entities. Yonder exquisite specimen
of the skill of man, in which mind appears to shine
through the marble,&mdash;that distant mountain which
divides the clouds as they are driven by the winds across
it,&mdash;those trees, amid whose branches the birds make
most melodious music,&mdash;this flower, so redolent of perfume,
so bright in colour, and so symmetric in form,&mdash;and
that lovely being who, a model of beauty and
grace, walks the earth an impersonation of love and
charity blended, making, indeed, “a sunshine in a
shady place,” are not realities. Certain forces combine
to produce effects, all of which unite to deceive poor
man into the belief that he is a material being, and
the inhabitant of a material world. There may be
ingenuity in the philosophy of this school; its metaphysics
may be of a high order; but it evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a>[Pg 410]</span>
advances from the real to the ideal with such rapidity,
that every argument is based on an assumption without
a proof; every assumption being merely a type of the
philosophy itself,&mdash;a baseless fabric, a transcendental
vision.</p>

<p>A material creation surrounds us. This earth,
all that it contains, and the immense hosts of stellar
worlds, are absolute entities, surrounded with, and interpenetrated
by, certain exhibitions of creative intelligence,
which perform, according to fixed laws, the
mighty labours upon which depend the infinite and
eternal mutations of matter. The origin of a grain of
dust is hidden from our finite comprehensions; but its
existence should be a source of hope, that those minds
which are <span class="correction" title="In the original book: alowed">allowed</span> the privilege of tracing out its marvellous
properties,&mdash;of examining the empyreal principles
upon which its condition, as a grain of dust,
depends,&mdash;and even of reducing these giant elements to
do our human bidding,&mdash;may, after a period of probation,
be admitted to the enjoyment of that infinite
power to which the great secrets of creation will be
unveiled.</p>

<p>Every motion which the accurate search of the experimentalist
has traced, every principle or power which the
physicist has discovered, every combination which the
chemist has detected, every form which the naturalist
has recorded, involves reflections of an exalting character,
which constitute the elements of the highest poetry. The
philosophy of physical science is a grand epic, the record
of natural science a great didactic poem.</p>

<p>To study science for its useful applications merely, is
to limit its advantages to purely sensual ends. To
pursue science for the sake of the truths it may reveal,
is an endeavour to advance the elements of human
happiness through the intelligence of the race. To
avail ourselves of facts for the improvement of art and
manufactures, is the duty of every nation moving in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a>[Pg 411]</span>
advance of civilization. But to draw from the great
truths of science intelligible inferences and masterly
deductions, and from these to advance to new and beautiful
abstractions, is a mental exercise which tends to
the refinement and elevation of every human feeling.</p>

<p>The mind thus exercised during the mid-day of life,
will find in the twilight of age a divine serenity; and,
charmed by the music of nature, which, like a vesper
hymn poured forth from pious souls, proclaims in devotion’s
purest strain the departure of day, he will sink
into the repose of that mysterious night which awaits
us all, tranquil in the happy consciousness that the sun
of truth will rise in unclouded brilliancy, and place him
in the enjoyment of that intellectual light, which has
ever been among the holiest aspirations of the human
race.</p>

<p>The task of wielding the wand of science,&mdash;of standing
a scientific evocator within the charmed circle of its
powers, is one which leads the mind through nature up
to nature’s God.</p>

<p>Experiment and observation instruct us in the discovery
of a fact;&mdash;that fact connects itself with natural
phenomena,&mdash;the ultimate cause of which we learn from
Divine revelation, and receive in full belief,&mdash;but the
proximate causes are reserved as trials of man’s intelligence;
and every natural truth, discovered by induction,
enables the contemplative mind to deduce those perfect
laws which are exemplifications of the fresh-springing
and all enduring <span class="smcap">Poetry of Science</span>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_269_269" id="Footnote_269_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269_269"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> This may be readily proved by the following simple but instructive
experiment:&mdash;Take two pairs of watch-glasses; into one
pair put a solution of nitrate of silver, into the other a weak solution
of iodide of potassium; connect the silver solution of each
pair with the potash one by a film of cotton, and carry a platina
wire from one glass into the other. Place one series in sunshine,
and the other in a dark place. After a few hours it will be found
that the little galvanic arrangement in the dark will exhibit, around
the platina wire, a very pretty crystallization of metallic silver,
but no such change is observable in the other exposed to light.
If a yellow glass is interposed between the glass and the sunshine,
the action proceeds as when in the dark. This experiment is
naturally suggestive of many others, and it involves some most
important considerations.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
